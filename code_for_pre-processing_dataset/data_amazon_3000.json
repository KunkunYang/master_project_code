I've had the Panasonic 5.8 GHz wireless phone for about six months, with 4 handsets (max total). Overall I like the system, but have a few complaints. First, I had the Siemens wireless system and had 6 handsets (could have 8 total) so buying this system reduced having a phone in the garage, and living room, not a big deal though, as if I'm working in the garage I just take a handset in there. My second and main complaint is I don't understand the voice enhancer (VE). The manual says something about making your voice clearer etc. but when I turn the VE on, I get comments like \"I'm having trouble hearing you.\" When I turn it off, people say \"That's a little better.\" It seems that we get complaints about people having trouble hearing us unless we use the speaker option, or use a headset. The final thing I don't care for are the \"missed calls\" on the handsets that didn't answer the incoming call. I'm constantly clearing that message from handsets, sometimes a handset that is rarely used will say \"34 missed calls.\" I see no reason for this feature, unless the call was actually not answered by any handset.The things I like about the phone system are the lighted antennas when ringing, the backlight, the speaker phone on each handset, good battery life and intercom system. However, I don't like the fact that you can only page from the main station, not from the handsets.Overall, it is a good phone system, would be an excellent system if my issues above could be resolved."]}

The jWin JX-M14 is a pocket sized radio that features AM, FM and 7 shortwave bands. It retails for around $30. Amazingly, it can be had for around $10 with a little shopping.The radio is in a stylish silver tone. The case has rounded corners and molded reliefs giving it a nice look. The front of the radio contains the speaker grill, LED lights for AM, FM and tuning, various controls and a digital readout. The antenna is fully positionable. Tuning and Volume are controlled by thin thumb wheels. On/Off is controlled by a little slide switch. There is also a jack for an adaptor (not provided) and an earphone (accepts a stereo plug, but delivers only mono). There is a little wrist strap and the back contains a flip-up tab to tilt the dial up when the radio is lying flat on its back.Power: Power is provided by 2 AA cells which should last a long time. If desired, an aftermarket adaptor could be used, but is probably unnecessary.Sound: The radio has a built in speaker and sound is consistent with a pocket radio. It is a bit better than the sound from a Grundig Mini 100 and a bit worse than a Sony S10MX2. The differences are small. This radio often comes with ear buds, but mine did not. Listening using an inexpensive Sony headset resulted in very pleasant audio (in mono).Ergonomics are strange; many things operate in a fashion that is backwards from what you would expect. One annoying fact is that the radio always reverts back to FM when it is turned off. The thumbnail controls are thin and the tight tuning knob tends to dig into your thumb.The radio also features a clock that seems to keep time reasonably well. The clock can also turn the radio on thereby turning the radio into a simple clock radio.There are no other features such as a dial light, bandwidth control or memories.Build seems to be a bit better than what I would expect. Quality control seems to be on par for a cheap radio.Tuning is analog, but the display is digital (using a simple digital counter). The last digit is missing when tuning shortwave, so a station at 6.155 will appear as 6.15 or 6.16. This is still vastly better than a slide rule dial.Reception:Note: Reception was done at my home which is about 35 miles west of Chicago. I'm also a few miles away from a couple of local broadcasters.MW (AM): MW reception was decent. The biggest problem was the jWin's wider than normal selectivity. With that said it performed well for an inexpensive pocket radio, but not as well as the AM/FM Sony S10MK2. Local stations came in fine and I was able to log many stations from other states including: Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Texas and Colorado.FM: FM was also decent. I was able to listen to most Chicago stations. Stations like WFMT at 98.7 came in loud and clear. WBEZ (NPR at 91.5) came in with some fiddling but I could hear another station softly at the same time. Here again the Sony did a better job, but I have definitely had pocket radios that did much worse.SW: The radio tunes the 49, 41, 31,25, 22, 19 and 16 meter international bands. Strangely, it often cuts off the lower portion of the band and extends past the upper portion. Despite using a single conversion design the radio is reasonably free from extraneous noises such as birdies, dit-dahs and the like. You will hear images of shortwave stations, but they are not too objectionable. I didn't hear a lot of bleed over from local MW and FM broadcasters into the shortwave bands, a surprising and welcome fact. The radio has enough of a dynamic range to allow the connection of 5-10 feet of wire (via alligator clip) to the whip antenna. This significantly increases the radios sensitivity to weak signals. In my radio it didn't overload the radio. Selectively is what you would expect in such an inexpensive radio, but it is acceptable.I was able to tune many shortwave stations (using 10' of attached bell wire).I heard numerous foreign language station and numerous religious/right wing stations. In two days of casual listening I was able to listen IN ENGLISH to stations from the following countries:SwedenEnglandHollandGermanySlovakiaCzech RepublicRussiaIsraelChinaTaiwanJapanThailandNew ZealandCubaCanadaUSIn the around $10 category there are not too many contenders. I personally know of the Coby 12 band and the Bell and Howell 9 band offerings. I can tell you that the jWin works better than either of these radios. The Grundig Mini World 100 is considered a good radio in the super cheap category. It retails for about $40 but it is often sold for $30. I wondered how this $10 radio would stack up. Listed below are the \"wins\" from each radio:Grundig Mini 100:- Wins at sorting out a weaker FM station next to a stronger FM station- Wins at being able to receive FM stereo- Wins with size (slightly smaller and lighter)- Wins with a plastic belt clip on the back of the radio (dubious value)jWin:- Wins with digital frequency readout instead of analog- Wins with more stable horizontal style- Wins with fully adjustable telescopic antenna- Wins with the addition of a digital clock- Wins with the addition of a wake to radio function- Wins with ability to pick up more MW (AM) stations- Wins with ability to pick up more SW stations in a given band- Wins with slightly better sound via the onboard speaker- Wins with having a power adaptor jack- Wins with visual indicators for bands, AM/FM and tuning- Wins with separate on-off switch- Wins with more shortwave bands (22 meters not on the Grundig)- Wins with a street price that is 1/3 the price of the Grundig- Wins with a tilt up bail on the back of the radioLet's face it, if you want a serious shortwave radio you have to pay the price. A nice starter is the Grundig S350 (street price $100). If you want a more sophisticated portable the Sony ICF-SW7600GR is quite nice (street price $170). Naturally, a high grade table top will cost thousands.But there are times when a multi-band radio would be nice, but you don't want to use an expensive piece of equipment. A trip to the beach or park would be one example. Camping also comes to mind. This radio would be great as a travel companion as it is small and it can also serve as a clock radio. At its throw away price it would also be great as a gift to a college student who is studying abroad (they can listen to the Voice of America to get the latest news). Solders in the Armed Forces would also find this radio handy. How about for a kid who has expressed an interest in radio (when they lose it, you won't be too upset at $10).Normally, I think of jWin products as being inexpensive, stylish but sub-par to terrible in performance. Despite its oddities, the JX-M16 does a fine job at an amazing price (if you shop around)."]}

Its construction assumes that I am focused right at the audio source of interest. If I am getting artistic with my shots, which I do, I want a bit more flexibility.

I use HP's photo imaging software that came with my HP digital camera.

Simply use the same molds to form these Ergo pick holders using flexible rubber compound. Don't know how cost effective that is compared to hard plastic.The next improvement needs to be in marking somewhere on the exterior of the pick holder just how many picks it is intended to securely hold without all of them falling out when you pull out one.That leads to improvement over the small metal clip that holds the picks in place.Point is that this product needs much improvement that can be done. It lasted me only two days after attaching it to my guitar.The first time I bumped it into something, the pick holder fell apart, thus I recommend better and more flexible materials that are molded into one solid piece - not somethng that has been slightly glued together.I tried re-gluing the holder back together and gently replacing the small medal clip, but it either holds too many or too little picks, and when I try slipping one pick out - they all fall out.Dunlop CAN DO BETTER!"]}

The final toasted panini still had to go into the microwave for a few seconds to melt the thinly sliced gruyere cheese so that I could serve it to my waiting friends.

I've absolutely never had a range problem in the house -- and can't even remember more than once when out in the yard I lost the signal.I find the sound quality good.

Sometimes the shape of the handsets doesn't feel comfortable cradled on my ear -- but I use the headset most of the time.One reviewed mentioned it being impossible to get messages from the handsets -- its actually simple. Hitting intercom then 9 brings you into the answering system.My few complaints are -- the issue of not being able to pick up a phone to join in an inprogress call (or switch phones) without transfering or conferencing the call in. I believe on the newer models you can set this feature -- (or on some model at least) as I purchased an additional handset recently and the directions on it mentioned that you could set to allow call barging (or whatever it was called) but you can't on my system. this is a pain when someone wants to pick up the line and all talk together or when I answer on the base then want to switch to the cordless (I have to transfer the call to the cordless -- like an office phone system).One anoying thing is that when the power goes off you have to reset the clock and date.

I've owned this shredder for over 6 months now, and I'm generally satisfied with its performance thus far. I use it on a usual basis to shred up old bank statements, credit card offers, and other sensative documents. Although the manufacturer claims it can do \"10 sheets of paper at a time,\" I find that claim somewhat exaggerated. I typically only shred 3 pieces of paper at a time, and even then the machine is growling. At this point, I'm not adventurous enough to experiment with 10. My roommate has shredded a few credit cards before, and the machine seems to take it just fine. I read that a fellow reviewer has even managed to shred CDs with his machine--that must be quite a show...The machine includes a reverse button if ever you feed it too much paper, and it jams. Again, since I only do 3 sheets at a time, I rarely have to use that button.The only complaints I have about the machine are its noise and weight. Every time I shred something, I like to joke with my friends that my paper shredder's \"getting ready to take off.\" Granted, the thing isn't as loud as a jet engine, but I certainly wouldn't place it near anyone watching TV or speaking on the phone. Perhaps the noise has something to do with the cross-cutting action? Secondly, the shredder is also quite heavy, so just be careful. In fact, the weight is probably why the manufacturer included the 4 rolling casters. But most people will probably place it in a permanent location, so I suppose weight isn't a lasting issue.As a last point, I just want to caution people against using this machine continuously for more than 30+ minutes. You have to remember that this is not an industrial shredder, so don't use it that way! Don't shred 10 pieces of paper at a time, non-stop for over 30 minutes. The folks who claimed that their machines broke down soon after they purchased it are probably the same people who decided to shred several years worth of documents (a la Enron) in the course of 2 hours. If I drove my car at 100 mph, non-stop for 2 hours, I could imagine similar breakdowns. So, exercise sound judgement and shred in moderation. Good night and good luck!"]}

We were needing some temp beds for our visits to our home out of state and found these on Amazon at an exceptional price. We got 2 twin mattresses instead of a queen so that we don't disturb each other as much when we shift and so we can split them up for guests that don't like each other that much ; ) Another reviewer had good advice to let them air out before use, because they do have an odor for the first 24 hours. They lost very little air over the 4 days we used them and virtually none during our evening use of them. Just add a little air prior to bedtime and you're good to go. I do recommend a blanket or comforter below you if you like sleeping with the room a little cool because the air in the mattress stays at the same temp and does suck all your heat away through the night. As for comfort, both me and my wife agree they were more firm than the pillowtop mattress we have at home, yet soft enough to give where you need it... and we both have back problems that are always aggravated by the standard hotel mattresses. We have slept on air mattresses in the past, but this was by far the best we have tried."]}

I realy couldn't go wrong with this one. At under $100 with free shipping and Amazons return policy... I got one just to test it out. I sent the first one back because it made my speakers squeal when I turned the amp on. Audiosource said it may be a problem when bridging 4ohm speakers. It was a problem with 4ohm, 8ohm, bridged or stereo. Anyway, the second one was fine. This amp doesn't have much power, so don't expect to run much of a subwoofer with it. It will power a sub, but when pushed, it may dammage your speakers, so keep your hand on the volume control when testing. You'll know when to turn it down... trust me. This amp is great for versitillity. With two speaker sets and the ability to run one set at 4ohm or 2 sets at 8ohm. Or if your like me, bridge A and B. I use a 4ohm butkicker for quiet nightime listening on speaker A or hit speaker B for a 4ohm 12\" Sony explode subwoofer. (Run 2 4ohm speaker at the same time bridged at your own risk!) This, I set up for my son's xbox360 as a perfect solution so I don't hear guns and bombs going off all night long. Bottom line is, for the price, it's great. I plan on taking it outside this summer to hook up to speakers on a gazebo. It's light enough to to carry around. It's a snap to connect. Just connect an mp3 player with a small headset to rca adapter and I'm done. Bannana connections are always a plus as well. A small complaint i have is the auto signal detector. It doesn't work at low volume. This is a bit annoying if you want good sound quality when somebody is sleeping in the next room. I'm being way to picky here. I just set it to manual. God forbid I have to push an extra button. If this thing breaks, I won't get to excited. Under $100 delivered!

Got this phone to work from home, along with 4 of my colleagues. The phone offers a very comprehensive set of features. We were also told it would work ok with a wireless network.The phone is difficult to use from the base station. The numbers are so close together it's easy to punch the wrong button. I guess that's the price you pay for having a small footprint, which the phone certainly has.The biggest problem we are finding is with the base unit. The speakerphone on the base cuts out, meaning large parts of conversations are missed. If it was just my phone I would have tried swapping it, but it's three different phones being used in three different houses.Uniden support suggested this was probably due to phone placement. They say the phone should be at least 5-6 feet away from electrical appliances. We're using the phones for work, which means within a few feet of a laptop computer. This seems to be the only common cause of the problem - unless the phones just have a flaw, but nobody else seems to have reported problems with the base unit speakerphone.It seems very odd that the problem is only with the base unit. I would have thought electrical interference (from a laptop) should affect the handset more, since it's wireless, rather than the wired base unit. That doesn't seem to be the case.One of my colleagues also reported 'garbled messages' when using voicemail. Interesting to see other comments here about voicemail not working.The phone probably offers the best set of features compared to other similar phones. Unfortunately the speaker phone problem is proving to be such a pain we're contemplating our options for returning the phones - hence only a 2 star rating."]}

I just purchased a KEURIG B77 one cup coffee maker simply because I like the idea of making coffee a cup at a time instead of having a pot (constantly heated - eventually burned) or a caraffe of tempid coffee that gets thrown out. Specifically I liked the option of a \"use your own coffee\" device which would (should) reduce the cost of using the system. Set up was easy and the system automatically heated its water and was ready to \"Brew\" when my feet hit the cold kitchen floor this morning - however, the coffee was weak and definately not to my taste. I opened the little filter canister (called the \"My K-Cup\") and discovered that over 50% of the coffee was dry and had simply been \"by-passed\" by the hot water, it seemed to have \"floated\" to the top of the \"My K-Cup\" and would now be thrown away - no wonder the coffee was weak and watered down. I re-read the instructions for the use of the \"My K-Cup\" and thought that I may have simply overfilled the device so I reloaded the filter with half my original amount of coffee and \"Brewed\" again - I watched the stream of coffee which started out dark and quickly turned nearly colorless - again the filter was filled with \"by-passed\" coffee - I would speculate that the same thing is happening inside the \"Pods\" which cost as much as $.75 each. While the system quickly heats water and brews quickly it appears that as much as 50% of your coffee is being wasted. I'm headed to the KEURIG web site for advice, but it looks like the device will be going back to the store - my old Cuisinart - Automatic Grind & Brew Thermal is still on the counter and while it makes more than I really need at one time, the coffee is robust, tasty and it doesn't waste my freshly ground coffee by simply pushing it out of the way."]}

I grew up with one button rice cookers. The kind I liked the best was one where you would put water on the outside of the rice pot as well as in the inside of the pot with the rice and then press the button. I don't think they make those anymore. Nowadays you have to keep the outside of the pot dry. Kinda a pain after you got it wet washing the rice.Back when I was growing up we made delicious rice, rice porridge, steamed sausage over rice, steamed chicken and vegetables in broth, bean soup, etc. using the simple one button rice cooker. The trick for some of the dishes is to run the cook cyle twice to cook longer.I mention all this to explain why just having a rice cooker cooking different things doesn't totally impress me. I'm used to having one that is simple to use and versatile.With this background, I was a little bit disappointed in the ZAC10 rice cooker although I still think it is an excellent product.This neuro fuzzy is CUTE. And it makes DELICIOUS oatmeal. It also makes cheaper rice taste better. The keep warm feature works perfectly -- no making a crust. I use the timer feature for oatmeal in the morning - very nice to have.But it is also awfully SLOW. I'm used to the rice cooker cooking faster than the stovetop method but this one is just as slow if not slower. For 1 small cup of rice it takes 40+ minutes. The machine I grew up with took 20 minutes. Even the quick cook feature on this machine takes 30 minutes.Theoretically you can't use this as a steamer according to the Ultimate Rice Cooker cookbook I also bought. That's too bad since I am used to steaming things in a rice cooker. I will play around with it though and see if that's really the case.I am still torn about whether to get this for my motherinlaw this Xmas. She loves oatmeal but cooked in milk so the timer feature won't help her. But still, it makes delicious oatmeal without her having to stand and stir. And it keeps it warm for a long time. What's making me hesitate is that she doesn't eat rice that often and the buttons in the front are rather daunting. (It really isn't as complicated as it looks though) Also the manual has no good recipes. It doesn't even tell you if you can make oatmeal with milk or not in it. (You can.) On the web they have some and if I were to get this for her I would definitely print out some recipes to go with it. This would be an expensive gift not to be used.If you eat rice alot or like rice, oatmeal, porridge, that kind of thing... a rice cooker is a must and this one is a great one. Just realize that if you're use to a one button rice cooker you'll be giving up simplicity.FOLLOW-UP:I have demoted this from a FIVE star to a FOUR star product. It still makes wonderful rice but disappointingly it doesn't handle oatmeal cooked in milk (1% fat). I've tried it three times now, two times on porridge cycle and this thing made a COLOSSAL MESS. Hubby said it's like a baby puked all over it, inside and out. The thing spewed oatmeal which stuck and dried everywhere (I got to it two hours after it went on keep-warm). Even though the inner part of the lid pops out, it still took nearly an hour to clean up the nooks and crannies of the thing. I definitely suggest watching it if you cook oatmeal with milk and maybe even opening it up several times to release the steam. Better yet, do it on the stovetop. Too bad because the oatmeal still left in the pot that it didn't spew out tasted fantastic.To be fair to the recipe, I should say I used quick cook oats (1 minute type) instead of the steel cut slow cook type oatmeal. Maybe that made a difference. BUt if so, too bad because I still have a lot of the other kind of oatmeal to use up."]}

If you're wanting a turntable for anything other than reviewing records whilst digging around your local thrift store or yard sales, or listening to old mono 10\"s in the garden on balmy summer afternoons then you'd do better looking elsewhere. There are a couple of different output options on the side, all of which are controlled by the volume knob on the top. For instance if you want to hook this up to a mixer you'd use the rca output which isn't a direct line- its still controlled by the volume, as are the two headphone outputs which also cut out the rca if you try to use them at the same time.The battery power option is cool though and the small, secure turtle shell lid is great for mobility but after a couple of weeks the clip holding the flimsy tone-arm in place broke off. As for the stylus itself its cheap sounding and nasty- no better than what you'd find on one of those old fashioned repro hifi combo's they sell in places like Bed Bath & Beyond or Target. The tone arm doesn't jump about but there is so much vibration that you can hear the records almost as loud when you have the volume turned down. When hooked up to a mixer and amp the sound is thin and missing that great low end that makes vinyl junkies all wobbly inside.to be honest I wish I'd spent a few more dollars and bought one of numarks larger, more solid turntables.If you're a dj that bought one of these then your mates have probably given you enough grief already.."]}

The laser is useful and works well, allowing me to focus attention on areas of a painting, image, map, or text with ease.Counterpoint to previous caveats:This very inexpensive product does not need an on/off switch! The simple convention of snapping the small unit it in or out is a clean design and works very easily.

It looks like a nice dark brown but especially when in sunlight, there is a violet sheen. I considered using a drabber because I prefer ash tones, but I didn't want to get too fancy.Another good feature of this product is when mixed with developer it becomes the consistency of custard in 5-7 minutes so it doesn't drip, but it also doesn't squeeze out of those pointy applicators -- you must use a bowl and brush.For the first year or so that I've been using this hair color, I was pretty happy. Then I guess I got more grey hair so that now, it doesn't cover it anymore. I've tried increasing the proportion of dye to CG (as in 'cover grey') developer from 1:2 to 1:1, or even stronger; leaving it in way longer than the recommended 45 minutes... but as soon as I finish the coloring process, I can already see hairs and roots that are very, very light. The color fades within 2-3 shampoos even though it's supposed to be 'permanent' hair color.Maybe my coarse Asian hair is more resistant or some other special factor like that, but I would not recommend Satin to cover grey.If I have to color my hair every 2-3 weeks, I may as well go back to Wella's Color Charm semi-permanent color of Deep Violet (3V) andWella Color Charm Creme Developer - 30 Volume 16 oz. It is an actual black (not brown) but a level 3 so not as severe as 1.

I purchased this air mattress for use when we have a full-house of guests. It received a lot of use during a seven-day period around this past Christmas. Because of space limitations, it was necessary to inflate the mattress each night and deflate it the following morning. (However, it was only folded in half to get it out of the way. We did not fold it into a small square that will fit into the storage bag.) TheIntex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pumpperformed to our satisfaction. No burst seams nor slow deflation during the night (as others have reported). Our guest (a teen) said that it was fairly comfortable. I had tried this air mattress immediately after purchasing it, and found that it was tolerable. Of course, I'm considerably older (and less flexible) than my teen guest.The unanswered question is: How long will this mattress last before it springs a leak? Since I use this mattress very infrequently, I may not have an answer until next Christmas. My expectation, based on my experience with another air mattress (that carried an \"Eddie Bauer\" label), is that this mattress might be good for three or four \"seasons\" before it's kaput.Like other reviewers, I had performed due diligence (both on the Amazon site as well as other sites) before purchasing an air mattress. In the end, I held my nose and bought this particular mattress simply because it appeared to be the best from a lot of poor choices.My 4-star rating reflects my opinion that this Intex mattress is a reasonably good value but its durability is an open question."]}

WOE BE UNTO YOU WHO CLICK 'ADD TO CART' or 'PURCHASE WITH ONE-CLICK' -- THERE IS ONLY PAIN AND AGONY HERE.....I would say that this item is a total waste of money, but that really fails to capture the magnitude of the hatred I have for this device. We bought one of these after having a cup of coffee at our car dealer while waiting for service, and much to my surprise, we had found the coffee tasted pretty good. So with an eye toward more convenience, less prep time in the morning, and less clean-up over all, we bought one of these \"things\" through Amazon -- note that I refuse to call it a \"coffee maker\" since - despite the tags on this review - it is CERTAINLY not THAT.For starters, the K-Cups are great, in terms of ease of use, but every cup of coffee our machine ever made from them tasted just like plastic. After several weeks of trying many different varieties and brands, we gave up, and bought the wire mesh K-cup filter and went back to grinding our own coffee by hand. (To add insult to injury, by the way, our old coffee maker, which made GREAT coffee, had had the grinder built in, so I had to go out and spend $[...] MORE bucks on a coffee grinder to go with this thing!) What they don't tell you, however, is that if you go that route, and sooner or later you will unless you like drinking molten plastic, then this thing is MORE TROUBLE and MORE MESS that the $[...] Mr. Coffee that's probably sitting on your counter right now.So making our own \"K-Cups\" fixed the problem, right? Hardly! After months of fiddling with the thing, trying different coffees, different grind settings, washing it out with vinegar per the mfr instructions many, many times, and doing everything else we could think of, we gave up. The \"clincher\" was when the flow dropped off and we couldn't get it to come back even though we cleaned it several times. You had to run the unit TWICE to get ONE cup of coffee. We had had enough. Finally my wife said, \"throw that thing away!\"Oh, how I had been waiting for those words.... Sentence pronounced, justice came swiftly for the K-Monster. I was the Executioner. What I did to that machine that morning cannot be spoken of, as I suspect it is probably illegal in several states. Suffice it to say that one of the happier moments of 2010 thus far was when I dumped what remained of the Keurig thing into the Herbie Curbie and walked away.Ultimately, after many many MONTHS of owning the K-Monster, and investing HOURS in cleaning, adjusting and tweaking it, I never ever got ONE SINGLE CUP OF COFFEE out of the thing that I thought was worth drinking or that I would have been proud to serve to a guest in my home. I can only laugh when I see people write that this thing brews an \"excellent\" cup of coffee.Save yourself a lot of time, a lot of trouble, (not to mention $[...] bucks or so after you buy a box of K-Cups), plus, and most importantly, a lot of grumpy mornings because - trust me - you'll be walking out of the house with a mug full of lukewarm coffee-tinged liquid that looks like pond water and which purports to pass itself of as as an \"excellent cup of coffee\", and you will be angry -- very angry! -- until you can swing through a Starbucks or Dunkin drive-thru to get a decent cup of real coffee...There are many coffee makers out there for one-half, a third, a quarter the price of this thing, or even $[...] or less, that actually make real coffee -- and far superior to what you will get from the K-Monster thing. Save yourselves the agony. Run the other way!"]}

For one thing, the coffee maker initially brewed AWFUL tasting water. It reeked and tasted of plastic, which I guess is a common problem. I had to \"flush\" out the brewer with white vinegar and then run through a bunch of tanks of water before the water would even taste OK. I think the issue has finally been resolved but it was a significant pain in the behind. And I think it could have easily been avoided if Keurig just used better quality plastic in manufacturing their coffee makers.Which brings me to my larger complaint: this thing just isn't well made. I can tell already that it won't last very long. It's all cheap plastic that is just waiting to break down. Keurig really should build their coffee makers with better materials.

While I was not expecting the quality of espresso I was hoping for much better than this delivers. I would rate it a below average drip machine taste. A much cheaper mocha pot produces a way better cup. The k-cups are very weak tasting. I use the smallest setting just to get a strong enough cup - this produces about 4oz. For a full cup you would need 3 K-cups. Out of all the K-cups produced there are only 2 decent ones - Donut Shop and Dark Magic (even though Donut shop is too weak for me it is smooth). Unfortunately these 2 cannot compare to even an average coffee prepared by a mocha pot. Don't bother wasting your time using the My K-cup accesory....it just does not work satisfactorily. The one plus this system has going for it is convenience. Flip a switch and 2 mins later you are ready to brew. It takes about 10 secs to brew the smallest cup. Very quick and very easy. In my opinion the K-cups are way overpriced...at 1/3 of their current price they would be an ok value. For now my unit is going back to Costco. A $20 mocha pot, cheap grinder, and Stumptown Hairbender whole bean produces a much better cup and costs 1/10 the price."]}

I guess I'll start by saying that I don't understand all of the good reviews for this thing. I absolutely hate it. I used to own a vegetable steamer, but my roommate needed it back. It was a very simple design: A pot that sits atop another pot, with a lid that fit either pot, and a cutout in the lid featuring an adjustable hole to control how much steam release you wanted.This steamer does not do that. And furthermore, I don't understand why the steamer needs to sit so low into the bottom pot. It means that you really can't be cooking pasta on the bottom, and steaming the veggies on the top. It sits so low into the bottom pot that the vegetables on the bottom of the steamer essentially end up getting boiled instead of steamed, because they are sitting in water.The black handles also get VERY hot. It also arrived with one of the handles broken. I have other pots that are this small, and the handles get no where near as hot.Overall I think that this is a cheaply made, poorly designed product with no real saving graces. Its design is a failure to allow you to both cook food on the bottom, and steam something on the top, because the steamer sits far too low into the bottom pot.I would not recommend this product to anyone, or buy it again."]}

This hot dog maker is obviously waay cute. It's also a good price. Compared to other cutesy hot dog makers, 8 dogs is a good number. I love the carnival themed umbrella sneeze guard over the dogs, and having that double as a bun warmer was an inspired idea. The poles that hold up the umbrella are nice and sturdy, and it assembles in only 1 minute. This thing has many bonus features:*Rollers look just like the industrial unit at your local convenience store. They really roll!*It can also handle 4 foot long dogs and even foot long buns! That's really great because my wife loves those. However, 4 is an anemic number.*Nostalgia went to the extra expense to include an on/off switch and even a temp control. Temp control should prove useful vs. devices that do not include that.*This unit includes a griddle attachment for hamburgers/bacon/sausage, etc. I think the unit is too small to be useful for frying hamburgers; you could only do two at a time. The griddle drops in where the rollers would otherwise go, so switching functions is not going to be convenient and will require tools or heat proof gloves if you don't want to wait for a cool-down period.*The heating element is a beefy rectangular coil that gives good coverage of the cooking area and is directly exposed to the dogs, yielding fast, strong heat.*The drip tray, griddle, and rollers are all removable for easy cleanup. Love that.*The rollers are beefy all metal construction - nice.So that adds up to one very nice unit, of which Nostalgia should be proud. The only real shortcoming I see is that eight dogs, while a good number for a toy device like this, can't stand up to much crowd control. Figure at least two dogs for each child, and three for each man and you're feeding only three to four people per batch. Assume the thing is lightning fast at ten minutes per batch and you see that you're going to need ten of these toys to feed your super bowl party, hahahaha.Then you have to ask yourself, is this gizmo worth the space? It's pretty big, about the size of a toaster oven. Will you keep it out on the counter and use this special purpose device often (doubtful)? How far back in the closet will it be stored and will you go to the trouble to drag it out to cook up dogs for three people, pack it back up, and re-store it (doubtful)? So is it worth the space? I think it's probably best suited for its intended audience: a party of four kiddos."]}

I must have got a lemon, because all the googling in the world doesn't help me with my problem. My printer goes to sleep mode and never wakes up, even after a cold restart (I'm using WinXP Pro SP2). Print jobs live indefinitely in the spooler and half the time need to be removed by restarting the spooler service. No one else seems to have the problem. However in debugging the issue, I've had to go through 4 online chat sessions with HP, totalling almost 6 hours, each session being less useful than the previous. I've tried different USB cables, different hubs, different ports, different drivers, and different computers. I've tried printing directly, bypassing the spooler, and various print processor options. All at their recommendation and assurance that it would fix the problem (they must have scripted responses they copy/paste into the chat because all the English and grammar is consistently bad).Finally they decided to replace the printer. They asked for my email address, mailing address, phone number, time of day to contact, and credit card number that will be on record in case I don't return the defective unit. The request for the ccard number is via a phone call, not asked for online. During this call, they conclude my printer is out of the 1-year warranty. I bought this printer about 4 months ago, and its manufacturing date isn't even a year out yet. Now I have to dig up my proof of purchase and fax it to them. They gave me a fax number and nothing else. I had to ask if some kind of reference number would be needed and was first told no, then the rep put me on hold and came back with a case # that I have to put on the fax. This is asinine coming from a company such as HP.Terrible. Unacceptable. Can anyone recommend a non-HP brand that I can have some kind of perceptible competence at customer service, let alone product quality? I am so sorry I ever laid eyes on this product. The defective unit is one thing, but the hoops I have to jump through when something goes wrong will keep me FAR away from any of HP's products."]}

I've owned a Digitech Death metal pedal for about 2 years now, and I love it. It provides a great uber-distortion sound, with a fair range of tone modification. The only negative that I'd point out is that the level of distortion isn't adjustable on the pedal. I'm sure more experienced guitarists deal with this by tweaking the volume knob on the guitar. Fair enough.As for the pedal being \"muddy?\" Ummm...the distortion on this thing has like 500x gain. You push a gnat fart through this, and it will sound distorted and muddy. Period. That's what happens when you jack up a signal, and clip it - adding all those harmonics and overtones muddy the sound. Try playing with the tone knobs (duh!) to clean up the sound. Or better yet, get better pickups for your guitar. This pedal won't make stock pickups sound like their active, though it'll certainally run with the ball a pretty good length in this regard. One of the guitars I have I've adjusted the stock humbuckers so that they're closer to the strings, and I get all sorts of metal nonsense from them when running through this pedal. Active pickups with this thing would sound absolutely insane.Also, feedback? Well, again, that's what you're going to get when you jack up the signal 500x (double duh!). The solution to this? Try switching your style to something a little more accomodating to feedback-less performance like a Air Supply cover band, or a Hall and Oates tribute band. I can get feedback from a mild overdrive pedal if I have a 50w amp jacked to 10, nevermind having this thing in the chain. So yeah, you're going to get feedback. Deal with it by not standing directly in front of the amp and thrashing about playing power chords.Finally, I have to agree that you can dial in a heavier distortion sound from a Digitech Grunge. The downside with the Grunge is that you have far less flexibility with the tone settings than with this pedal - the devil here is in the details. Inbound and outbound tone filtering on a distortion is at least 50% of your tone and sound, so having a distortion with three tone knobs, as opposed to two, provides far more flexibility to the average guitarist. The only other way you're going to get a better tone is having a full-on EQ, which I don't see many people offering these days. There are few pedals, like the Boss, that have a four-knob EQ, but frankly I think the distortion on these suck. They're not heavy enough, not sensitive enough, and just sound all-around anemic. I use the Digitech Death Metal all the time, and love it."]}

First, this rice cooker takes forever to cook. I mean twice longer than a regular simple rice cooker. Why? Because it requires 120V while we all use 110V. I dont know why the manufactur does that since it sells to U.S. Second, the texture of the rice that it cooks tastes as good as a $30.00 rice cooker. Third, the cooker use battery. Battery will die.

I was expecting the bold tricolor look featuring three bands of blue, red and white, which are the flag colors of many countries. (For instance, I am a citizen of both New Zealand and the USA, and these three colors are those of both flags.) Instead, the capos that arrived featured an American flag design. When I contacted the merchant about the discrepancy, they were most helpful and offered me a refund. They said that the image on Amazon is of an old design no longer manufactured, and my capos were the current version. They said they would ask Amazon - perhaps had already asked Amazon - to replace their image with a new one. I see this has not happened yet, so I have gone ahead and loaded some images of the current look.I kept the capos anyway - they work really well - but, had I known before I ordered that I would get something different than what is shown on Amazon, I would probably have ordered a couple of differently colored Kysers.

I purchased this air mattress for use when we have a full-house of guests. It received a lot of use during a seven-day period around this past Christmas. Because of space limitations, it was necessary to inflate the mattress each night and deflate it the following morning. (However, it was only folded in half to get it out of the way. We did not fold it into a small square that will fit into the storage bag.) TheIntex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pumpperformed to our satisfaction. No burst seams nor slow deflation during the night (as others have reported). Our guest (a teen) said that it was fairly comfortable. I had tried this air mattress immediately after purchasing it, and found that it was tolerable. Of course, I'm considerably older (and less flexible) than my teen guest.The unanswered question is: How long will this mattress last before it springs a leak? Since I use this mattress very infrequently, I may not have an answer until next Christmas. My expectation, based on my experience with another air mattress (that carried an \"Eddie Bauer\" label), is that this mattress might be good for three or four \"seasons\" before it's kaput.Like other reviewers, I had performed due diligence (both on the Amazon site as well as other sites) before purchasing an air mattress. In the end, I held my nose and bought this particular mattress simply because it appeared to be the best from a lot of poor choices.My 4-star rating reflects my opinion that this Intex mattress is a reasonably good value but its durability is an open question."]}

It simply stops functioning - and the other reviews are right, it is usually right after warranty. After buying my first few on Amazon.com and having no luck on the return, I started getting them at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Ordering on Amazon is easiest because it's a heavy box. I rarely return things I get on Amazon. And this particular purchase simply can't be returned after warranty. Bed, Bath, and Beyond has a very liberal return or exchange policy. The Keurig lasts barely a year. I admit, I love this machine and the instant nature of it, and the widening great coffee selections, yummy coffee selections...and I am almost giving up. I'm on my 10th or 11th pot - and after the descaling as they constantly tell you to do, my latest machine is once again starting not to work. The first sign is the cup of coffee that pours through is smaller than the cup size you selected. When this happens - if you are still in warranty time - get a new pot. This marks the beginning of the end. The frustration from the time this starts to the time I give up on the pot basically ruins that morning cup of coffee that is supposed to be so great - and is until the pot breaks. I hold my breath hoping the cup size is right, I wonder if it will work. Yes, I'm clearly obsessed with my first cup of the day. After that, I don't care. That first cup - well, no one can mess with that...I don't have a solution and I still have my pot. I admit I'm starting to look at the other pots like this out there to see if they are better quality. I'll say it again - I love this machine. I give it a 5 in concept. The quality just isn't there and for the price of these pots, I really believe we deserve more than a year or less of use."]}

It is just a two step wizard style dialog box, and on the last page you design, print and calibrate. Using the self explanatory controls on the last page I easily succeeded in creating some pretty nifty labels using my best photographs. Some people have apparently had problems with the calibration, but I was lucky and I got perfect labels on my first try.When I print it comes off correctly and the slightly thicker label paper has never jammed my printer (a C6180 all-in-one). You can print one or two labels at a time. The labels come off easily and if you use the label applicator you are almost guaranteed to line up the label correctly on the DVD/CD. However, 90% of the time I do not use the label applicator, I just do it by hand, which is quicker. The label ends up in the middle of DVD/CD anyway. The greatest risk for problems is when you take the label off the paper. The label may curl up and get stuck on your fingers. Since I can only speak for myself, and not for those who had problems calibrating, I highly recommend this product for label printing."]}

After all these reviews I expected the Greatest Strings Ever, golden strands of Glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection!Instead, I got a decent set of .10's that lasted a whole hour before the D snapped at the neck pickup. I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and I pre-stretch them gently but completely. Plus I tune down to Eb for vocal and breakage reasons, so I break very few of my normal strings, Slinky .10's. Ergo, a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension, tuned down, is unacceptable, especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings.As for the tone, it's definitely bright and almost too edgy, but nicely zingy all told. Yet one negative I've noticed after about 8 hours' loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings, making them harder to tune. Sounds odd, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles ain't cheap either at triple the price, please note), I've since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir strings.So, I must say I'm summarily unimpressed so far with Elixir electric strings.What's the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast?Especially when it costs three times more?And what's up with the tuning thing?And why do these cost so much more, anyhow? Is a micro-thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string? Not when that string is toast in 50 minutes, zero doubt there.Anyhow, I've got five Elixirs and one Slinky on my main ax now, so as they age I'll get a good feel for how the Elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone, and I'll report back here in a while. And by the way, that Slinky D sounds almost exactly the same as the Elixirs, tonally. So much for Magic Elixir Tone.Don't get me wrong, I really do want to love these, as I hate changing strings, but geez guys, how about some quality control?If I'm going to pay triple the price, then is it crazy to expect triple the quality? Or heck, even just a little better...PS If you look at the D'Addario reviews (I love their acoustic strings), they respond to many of the reviews and questions. I hope that Elixir will do the same here and address my questions.[Edit: And now, after only six hours' of playing on that guitar, the B string popped at the same place as the D, neck pickup. Once again I ask: what good are strings that \"sound good three times longer\" if they break three times faster?][Edit: 10/31/12. Come on! After four more hours, the A string went. I only play that ax one or two sessions a week, and the next time I joked to the drummer, \"Which one will go today?\" He said he's amazed the G is still on, as he plays too and knows the G takes the most tension.

The base is in a central location (same place the V-Tech was) and none of the handsets is more than 100 feet from the base. The results: The 3 most peripheral handsets constantly lose their connection to the base and disconnect calls, rendering them effectively useless. The 3 handsets in what I would term the midrange zone hold their connections but have frequent but brief episodes of sound dropout. The remaining handsets, all within 25 feet of the base, sound good on my end but apparently not so great on the other parties' end.Other drawbacks are an incredibly clumsy paging system, a caller ID call-back system that requires extra steps to select the dialing method each time (i.e., area code, 1+ or just the 7 digits must be selected every time), the need to setup the phonebook and speed dial on each handset individually, awful sound quality in both directions when using the handsets' speakerphone (dys)function, and lastly (but not least!), the inability to ever silence the base ringer.On the plus side, the base speaker phone is superb and actually sounds better to callers than does the handset.To say the least, I am really disappointed and terribly sorry I didn't keep all the boxes and packaging."]}

The pan sizes are great for the everyday meals that I usually cook, although most folks will need to add a 10-12 inch saute pan. The rims are great for pouring and the handles actually stay cool stove top. Sticking and clean up have not been a problem. I would say that the pans create too little fond. The skillet is also a little slow to regain temperature after adding thicker cuts of meat. The main concern is an issue with the stainless steel interiors. There are specs of dull metal (exposed aluminum?) developing on the interior of the pots except the skillet. One sauce pan actually has a finger sized spot of exposed aluminum near the lip that I didn't see when I first examined them. The interiors of the pots except the skillet, easily discolor from heat but recuperate a little after consecutive uses. I called Cuisinart about the exposed aluminum. The rep had a scripted answer for my concern so it seems this may be a common problem. The expense of sending the pots to them for repair or replacement and being without pots for that time prohibits any warranty fulfillment. I'm leery about the cooking surfaces of pots and pans so I hope the problem doesn't get worse and food begins to stick or worse the aluminum begins to break down and leech into the food. Also, the exterior that is not \"brushed\" is easily marred and scratched which might matter to someone interested in exhibiting them. Overall, these are \"okay\" for the money. Especially since one All-Clad piece can cost as much as I paid for this set.At under $200 the price was good, but for someone from my socio-economic background it's still a lot to spend on pots and pans. I'd rather not spend that much on fallible materials.02/23/2010 - Two years later, still going strong. I still can't make an omelet in the fry pan, but an eco-pan non stick should do the trick there. There's no further damage than initially discovered. I'd say these were definitely worth the money. No dents or dings, no permanent burnt on food.

These coffee brewers are marvelous. The concept of being able to brew a cup or cups of coffee in less than a minute from a machine that is always on and ready is beautiful for coffee drinkers, tea drinkers, and hot chocolate drinkers. However, these neat machines with modern styling are prone to early failures. The nature of the failures are based on the design, not the quality of the parts, not the assembly, and not the users. Just fundamental problems with handling water and air. The two aren't mixed but air is used to move water. Air pumps don't like water, water pumps don't like air. These machines can seem broken when the problem is often air locks or blockages.The tank filter is dirty, the tank screen is dirty, the cup puncture parts are dirty are some of these issues. Sometimes, if the machine functions long enough there are scaling problems from calcium deposits on the metal parts, usually the heating unit. Most coffee parts need cleaning with vinegar, routinely. Dirt or minerals in the water clogging filter screens, pumps, heaters are expected, but usually, for most of us, those problems are apparent in the second or third year of use.As a potential buyer you rely on reviews, like mine, to advise you on practical problems with things you buy. Take a minute and go to YouTube and search on Keurig repair, notice the number of videos presented on fixing your coffee pot. Notice that repairs are often needed within the first twelve months (12 months). Do you expect to have problems with a coffee maker in the first year? Probably not.Call Keurig when you have a problem and those wonderful people will send you a new one, many time even if your machine is out of warranty. They ask for the serial number and the date you purchased. They may ask you to send a small part back to them. Days later you have a brand new machine. Who could ask for better service than that, you ask. Answer, no one could ask for better service. In my opinion the service is the only thing propping up Keurig. They will replace the machine, free, and quickly. They will help you troubleshoot. They are nice people doing a good job.Never the less, the machine had design problems. Small pumps get wet because of the lack of check valves, small parts get clogged with dirty water. Air blocks occur easily when filling the machine or adding water. Carbon filters become clogged. The machine is not designed for servicing. You can take one apart and many owners do. They make repairs to their machine because they love the way it works, when it works. Look at the videos on YouTube, read the Google results for a Keurig repair search, talk to your friends about their experience. Do all of that before you buy.Now, listen to me carefully. I have owned five of these machines. I bought the first one as a dare. I couldn't find the coffee cups in stores when I bought - I had to go online to buy them. I love the damn thing and I love the things it makes for me, soup, hot chocolate, tea, instant oatmeal, and coffee. It looks good, it makes little motor sounds and waterfall noise while it works. It is like a small robot friend that makes me happy all day with wonderful service. And so you can understand that when it doesn't work, for whatever reason, I get into a foul mood and think evil thoughts about the product design team. I want them to come to my house and visit with me while I smack their knuckles with a ruler. I want to take them out to my garden shed where, above the yard chemicals, the yard tools, on their own dedicated shelf I have lined up four models of Keurig and one other brand. I had hope the other brand would be better, no so much.Please fix these minor problems and produce the perfect coffee maker, I know you can do it!"]}

If you have a Hewlett Packard PS 100 photo printer, this is the perfect paper to use.The printed area is 4x6; the paper is photo glossy; and each sheet includes a (perforated) tear-off tab -- which allows the PS 100 to print borderless 4x6 prints.(My technical friends tell me that the tear-off tab allows the printer to hold on to the paper -- so that the printer can print all of the way up to the 6&quot; perforated edge. Without the tear-off tab, the PS 100 will stop printing sooner, 1/4&quot; before the edge of the paper, cutting off the image.)Don't be confused by HP's other 4x6 papers (which don't come with the perforated edge).If you want to make beautiful, borderless 4x6 glossy photos on your PS 100 printer, this is the paper you'll want to buy!(As additional info, this paper will also work in HP's Photosmart 1315 which has a special 4x6 paper tray. The 1315, unfortunately, does not print borderless, so the benefit of this paper's tear-off tab is somewhat wasted.

October 2004 Update:I've had the card two years now, and there are starting to be a few games that want more than 64MB of memory. This week the fan on the board started making noise and I am looking for a replacement fan. I don't think I'm quite ready yet to trade this in, as long as I can fix the fan.Original review 10/2002:I uprgraded to this in order to play No One Lives Forever 2 because my old RivaTNT wasn't supported. The reviews recommended either GeForce4 Ti or the ATI 8500. A comparison of models and prices led me to the All-in-Wonder 8500DV. I liked the idea of the TV tuner, as I had one years ago, but it didn't survive the upgrade to Win98 (but that's another story).The original install on my Win2K machine went almost as smooth as expected. It wouldn't let me run the driver install before installing the card, and then when I did install the card, it popped up a dozen or so \"found new hardware\" dialogs. It finally stopped that, and I was able to run the installer. Everything seemed to be OK, but I went directly to the ATI website and got the latest drivers. 5 out of the 6 download options were newer than the ones on the CD, so I tried doing the updates. BIG MISTAKE. The upgrade instructions were confusing (ok, so I didn't look at them too closely, I DON'T NEED TO READ INSTRUCTIONS!) about when to reboot and when to say no to the prompts. I went ahead and let it reboot at the wrong time, and I got a dozen or so \"found new hardware\" messages, this time no amount of pointing at the CD, the downloaded files, the windows directory, etc would recognize these devices as having ANY valid drivers. Bummer. Re-install from the CD. Redo the updates without rebooting at the wrong times. Bingo! Everything works except two drivers. I had to go to control panel and \"update driver\" manually. This time it found the correct driver in the Windows directory. Finally it worked.(Now, back to playing NOLF2. It was happy with the video card, but the intro video was choppy. The game plays pretty smooth, not great, but good. Reading through the tech support stuff, I find I need more system RAM to fix that. We'll see if that helps.)As for the features of the 8500DV, the TV tuner is great. I really like the pause TV, especially with a second window open of the live video, it works better than picture-in-picture. The RF remote control works fine, but the mouse movement seems sluggish and I can't find a speed setting for it. I intend to route some cables from the computer to the living room TV and see how good that looks. Svideo length limit is supposed to be 35', I think it should reach."]}

These Grover 18:1 Rotomatics dropped in my 1990 Gibson SG Special (3 knob version) with absolutely no modifications, routing, or reaming. The guitar originally had the typical Kluson &#34;Deluxe&#34; tuners. Installation was simple with a screwdriver and small wrench. Eazy breezy. It took 20 minutes.The stock Gibson Kluson tuners were terrible (always losing tune), and I love Grovers. So, it&#8217;s no surprise I&#8217;m happy with these. However, as some other buyers have noted, these Grovers changed the tone and playability of my SG dramatically &#8211; and for the better. The guitar is now noticeably punchier and more musical. What a pleasant surprise! I&#8217;m kind of blown away by it.All that said, these are a bit heavier than Kluson tuners, so beware that your guitar neck will be heavier than before. But I feel it&#8217;s totally worth it.I bought these here on Amazon and the seller delivered them quickly. Price was great too. Thanks! I couldn&#8217;t be happier with this purchase."]}

It's really a beautifully built device with one enormous flaw. The screen is a disaster. I ignored the advice of some previous reviewers who warned about the viewing angle issue with the screen. Boy were they right! If you are buying this device primarily to view photos then steer elsewhere (see my recommendation below).First this is a nicely designed device. It has such a solid feel, with a slim form factor, a tightly engineered, elegant interface and button set. It feels great in the hand. Creative's engineers should be congratulated.Except for that screen.It's simply unusable. Sure it's big, and dense with pixels and color. On paper it seems incredible. But it's not incredible to look at. Just as previous viewers said, at best when you view pictures you must hold this thing at an ridiculously restrictive angle, and with one eye closed or the image will distort and shimmer badly. Essentially incredibly narrow viewing angle and the binocular nature of human eyes will be enough to create shimmering with this frustrating screen. I showed it to my wife and she agrees.Video playback suffered a similar effect though not as dramatic.One other smaller issue was that you can't zoom photos so if you want to preview to look for blurring and such you can't use this device.What a shame. I really almost considered keeping it because it's just such a nicely designed piece.Anyway I sent mine back and with some reluctance ordered the Epson P-2000.The Epson arrived a few days ago. The screen is wonderful. Everything the Vision should have been. Clear, sharp and easily viewed from a much wider angle. No shimmering at all. Same size, same dimensions (640x480) but has a zoom feature that works very well.The Epson doesn't have the same tight build and the device is a considerably bigger in size, with a slightly cheaper, plastic body. Slightly bigger hard drive. Also has an SD/MMC card slot in addition to the CF slot. Essentially the same functions as the Vision but no FM radio. I didn't buy the Vision for the radio.That said I'm really happy with the way pictures appear on the Epson and will certainly keep it but still miss the build quality of the Vision."]}

I talked my boss into buying a LaserJet 1020 for me to use at work, mostly for printing work tickets and service requests for equipment that needs to go out for factory repairs. (We're a two-way radio shop.) We previously used an ink jet for this purpose. It got to the point where we were buying a $30 cartridge every couple of weeks. Sure, we tried refilled cartridges; sometimes they worked, sometimes not. Also, the inkjet was frustratingly slow, especially when we had a customer standing there waiting for their paperwork!The 1020 has roughly the same footprint on the desk as an average ink jet unit, the print quality is a bit better and as far as speed goes it simply blows the ink jet away! Of course, it doesn't do color, but that's not a consideration in our application. We've been using the original toner cartridge that came with the printer for a few months now and it's still printing just fine. HP says it's good for about 2000 pages per cartridge, or more if you use the 'toner saver' mode, which we're using. Toner saver reduces the print quality just a bit, but we're printing service tickets, not wedding invitations.Unlike some other budget printers, the $69 (list price) cartridge includes everything; you don't need to replace a drum (that costs more than a new printer!) after a few thousand pages. One inexpensive laser printer is well known to crunch envelopes with frightening regularity. I can tell you from personal experience that the 1020 handles envelopes just fine. The print won't smear if your envelope catches a few raindrops on the way to the mailbox, like certain inkjets.The only cons I can think of is that it's just a little bit noisy and it's somewhat slower than the big machines in the front office. No big deal in either case, especially considering the price. All in all, I liked it enough that I bought one to use at home. The only thing that annoys me about that is that it's suddenly about $40 less than I paid! Oh, well... By the way, the printer is manufactured in China, but isn't everything these days."]}

The 6500B was the last one I tried of three. I've had cordless Panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again. But the other choices had major drawbacks. I really needed a two-line phone that wasn't 2.4Ghz.The first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866. It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too. This phone uses phone company voice mail (no built-in ans mach) - which is fine - but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it. For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stutter-tone so didn't know there were any new messages - arrgghh. Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope.Next I tried the new Motorola MD7081. I really wanted to like this phone. It's a 2-line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B. I liked it's simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2. Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three. But, it's answering system has no message counter. That alone is no big deal but it didn't have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages. When a new message arrived it blinked and such - all good. But, if I got home, say, and listened to a message for my wife, the blinking stopped and no indication of \"1 saved message\" or anything. So, I would have to write a note to her to check the messages. We're so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it's not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance. I also would have liked an auto-line-selection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a non-busy outgoing line. But, that would have messed up their simpler style button function - hmmm.The Panasonic, I am surprised to say, ended up being my favorite. Hopefully it will be reliable. I was always bothered by Panasonic's phones losing the date/time with any little power outage. Happily, this phone sets its date/time from caller-id info even though the manual implies it wouldn't work quite that way. With the right settings and phone company options (busy-forward), it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one. I really like not thinking about which line is what - just pick up and talk.The 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range. It's much lighter than earlier caller-id handsets which I like. I also like their shape of handset the best. My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets - I would like 6 or 7. Also, can't name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number."]}

I talked to friends who had a rice cooker (not this brand) that they were happy with and then I read the reviews on Amazon and other sites. This cooker apparently was rated highly by Cook's magazine and was reasonably priced. Since most of the negative reviews seemed to be about ease of cleaning, I thought it would work out. It seems to only be available online, either from Amazon or Walmart (online only). The day it arrived I read the directions thoroughly (some reviewers mentioned that measurements need to be fairly precise) and followed them. The manual mentioned that white rice would be ready in about 30 minutes but did not mention how long it took for brown rice to cook, though it had some suggested recipes. I just cooked basic brown rice in a small quantity. Well it took one and a half hours for it to be done and it was quite soggy. I was not willing to keep the item and \"tweak\" the process to try to get decent rice, so I cleaned it up and repacked it and checked on the return process. Since this item was not handled by Amazon directly I had to contact the company that sent the product with an email and wait for them to approve my reason for returning it and give me a return authorization code to include with my packaging. They did approve the return and I sent it back via UPS. It cost me over 17 dollars for the return shipping (not anthing expedited, just regular UPS that was supposed to take about 10 days for it to reach the destination). I tracked the package until it reached the seller and then waited for my refund. When a month had passed and still no refund I called them to let them know.

You can work around this by removing and replacing the tank when you detect it is not pumping.I have not tried to contact the company as it will only tick me off to be given a similar line of crap from them as I see so many here have already gotten.

This scanner works, most of the time. I am moving toward the (still distant) paperless office, and this scanner has gotten me much closer. However, I can't recommend purchasing one because it has some maddening problems that just don't seem to be tractable.The DocuMate 510 doesn't work at all with Windows Server 2003, because apparently corporations don't need to scan documents.On Windows XP, it provides both TWAIN and WIA drivers. In my case, I can choose between the TWAIN driver, which inverts the colors of all black and white scans (the option to correct this simply doesn't work on my PC), and the WIA driver, which ignores the auto document feeder, forcing me to babysit the machine while it scans. I've worked around this in Microsoft Office Document Scanning with a greyscale scan that converts to black and white, but that slows it down from its rated 10ppm to about 3.The Documate 510 software bundle includes (indeed, centers around) PaperPort 9 Deluxe, which allows scanning to PDF. Despite the \"Deluxe\" this product is crippleware, designed to entice you to buy the \"real\" version: PaperPort Pro. Except PaperPort Pro is now at version 10, which isn't really compatible with this scanner, due to the driver problems mentioned above (which are pervasive no matter what application is used, except the shipped version of PaperPort 9 Deluxe appears to have some kind of workaround).I've tried several times to reinstall the drivers in the hopes of correcting some of these issues. Doing so requires on-the-spot \"registration\" every single time, including typing in the 20-character alphanumeric serial number from the back of the unit. As an added bonus, it requires you to enter your email address and subscribes you (with no indication that it is happening) to Xerox's marketing email list.I believe this scanner is actually made by Visioneer, who sells or sold it under another name (4650?) and OEM'd to Xerox as the Documate 510. The \"beauty\" of OEMing a product made by someone else is that you can take it to market without a single person in your organization knowing how it works.

I bought this because we have an Airport Express in the basement, and built-in speakers on the main level with wires near the Airport Express. A variety of other amplifiers were unsatisfactory because they were always on, had terrible ground loop buzz when there was no input, and/or had their inputs randomly reset by children and power outages. This amplifier is set up for a PA system with elevator music. You just feed the Airport Express output into the overridable (elevator music) input, and leave the override input unconnected. You could connect it to an override input, if you want this functionality, but I didn't. What makes this amplifier perfect is that it has an autopower function, so it turns itself off when there's no audio input, and turns itself on when it detects an input. This has worked without a hitch for the last 5+ weeks. Now, anytime we want to play iTunes to the main level speakers from any computer, it reliably works. Also, no annoying ground loop hum with no input. Love this amplifier. A perfect solution for my situation. Not sure if power failures will be an issue. I don't think I've had any since getting it. However, most of the configuration is hard switches or automatic, so if it is an issue, I only anticipate having to push the main power button."]}

It is also a very good improvement over its predecessor, the Casio FX-2.0, with a very fine portable design and now with a CAS (Computer Algebra System). The pros and cons as I see it are:PROS:1) It has all the standard regular features and also is supplied with a full set of CAS features that we have come to expect on such a machine.2) The machine itself is reasonably fast with a nice graphical interface and resultant plotting system. The resultant plots are high quality and with the many added features available for enhancement are very intuitive for the learning process.3) It has a nice, but older style, body design that sits very nicely both on a desk or a table as well as in your hand.4) It has a large amount of onboard main memory, plus additional Flash memory (See Con below) for tackling quite memory intensive problems.5) Although it is called a calculator, it is really a small and fast handheld computer system which can tackle problems from the most simple to almost the most complex.6) It has a very useful user interface system with multiple icons. The calculator functions are all controlled using an Algebraic Operating System (AOS).CONS:1) Some functions that you would readily expect to be available with a single key press on the main keyboard require instead multiple key presses, but usually with only a single shifted key press first.2) Apparently the Flash memory is not extremely well made or of very high quality and can degrade significantly over a period of a couple of years time."]}

I have tried 5 sets of these DR Rare strings on two different guitars, and the result has been the same every time, regardless of the instrument. Admittedly, I play hard and a lot of my initial pick attack strikes the 4th - 6th strings, but to have the same strings consistently break after 14 hours or less of playing is ridiculous. Moreover, I know the culprit is the DR strings and not my playing style, because every time the breakage occurs, I replace the DR string with same-gauge D'Addario phosphor bronze strings (not the EXL version, available in singles), to get me through until I choose to replace all of the strings and re-string with a whole new set. Although they do not have the same bass response that I so love in the DR Rares, the D'addarios do NOT break. So I know the problem is the DR strings. However, it may well be that these DR strings will be entirely suitable for players with a less aggressive or more broadly-distributed plectrum attack -- but if you play hard, beware!

I grabbed my Jansport bag (or so I thought it was one) and went to meet her a few yards from my house. I saw that some of the shopping bags which are plastic bags burst because of some of the groceries, so it only made sense that I carry a JanSport bag. I packed as much of her groceries in this bag and then when I was a few feet away from arriving at my apartment the top right hand side of the second compartment ripped. This was the same compartment that was normally used to hold my laptop, I don't know if it was already weakened by me carrying my laptop around in it everyday and did it finally gave in when I carried groceries in it? These groceries were much lighter than my Dell Laptop so whatever. I immediately started to wonder if this bag is an authentic JanSport bag and still wonder to this day. Believe me if it wasn't a Jansport bag I would have declined to help my room mate with her groceries(kidding) or asked her to locate a bag of her own that I could use to help carry her groceries.When I bought this (Firewire should be called dullwire)it was $50 and no I don't think it was worth it because I had another JanSport bag prior to buying this one and it is still intact. I only bought this Jansport Firewire, to put my laptop in, it did protect my laptop for the year or so that I was using it. I carried around my laptop pretty much everyday because I study everyday at the library on-campus at the university I attend. Unfortunately for me when it ripped at the top I stopped wearing this JanSport firewire and went back to my previous old normal JanSport(everyone knows the very popular ones with only two compartments) one and now appreciate it more than I did before. I now also carry around a SEPARATE bag for my laptop. All in all, I don't recommend this product if you want to carry a laptop just save your money and buy a separate bag for that and stick with your original JanSport bag(yes those same two zipper ones)which I assume everyone has by now.

The needles never clogged and I had great tasting coffee every day.

This offer will never expire, so I was not pressured to purchase another over the phone. This puts the price at $79.95 for the new brewer (he assured me that it was not a refurbished model either).

One Star because I absolutely had to. Where are the negative stars?I bought this stand for roughly 25 bucks at Novamusik.com. Yeah, it is a cheaper stand, but I am writing this review because it's advertised in such a way that will surely mislead someone to think that it is something that it is not. First of all, the stand is your standard tripod boom stand, which is a tripod based straight stand with a boom attatchment (for those who have never purchased a boom stand before). The stand is made of tubular steel, and the metal is actually decent. The boom attatchment is fine. The main issue with this stand is the polycarbonate base upon which the legs are attatched.It's plastic. The legs are atttched directly to plastic by a screw. The packaging and the website both brag upon this design flaw stating \"The legs will bounce back if stepped on.\" This isn't the case at all. If you step on it, the plastic turns white and weakens before it breaks. There is no mechanism, there is no shock absorption system in this stand at all. I had JUST opened the package and I was testing the resiliency of this \"feature\" when the leg snapped away from the base. Yes I applied more than necessary force, yes it was stupid, but nontheless I feel that I didn't apply the same level of force that someone would have if they had stepped on it. I told Novamusik not to worry about replacing it as I knew It was my fault. I never intended on pretending that this was some fluke accident.This \"bounce back\" feature was what made me buy the stand.This \"feature\" is not even a legitimate safety feature. They are rationalizing the fact that they cut corners. Of corse the base is flexible...its plastic. It's like automobile makers that make plastic bumpers that proclaim \"if you get into a wreck, just put some heat on the bumper and it will bounce right back\" it's a cost saving measure that they market as a feature but ultimately, the base is weakened and was not designed for this purpose. It can be more accurately described as a one-time feature. Like a motorcycle helmet, the one time you hit it, you weaken that styrofoam, and it is no longer effective in it's purpose.Every other boom stand that I have seen, that I own, that I have paid a similar price for, the legs are attatched to metal.Also, the packaging states that the stand has \"replacable parts\" this is also blatantly untrue. I called and spoke with Scott Rickett (spelling) who said \"Well, how much did it cost?\" implying that the cost was negligible, and continued \"It's just too cheap for us to stock individual parts for so we just sell the whole thing. Im sorry, and I hope you choose quicklock in the future\" in a way that was very disingenuous. He did say that it sounded like my breakage was considered out of warranty/misuse and I didn't argue that. I was really hoping that I could get a replacement stand at cost or something because their advertising was definately misleading. Overall he did not sound interested in speaking to me at all, and the entire conversation was rushed.Oh, it should also be noted that in the small number of times that I tightened and loosened the clutch since the other day, the rubber on the grip is coming off on the inside.So to sum up, there is no shock absorbtion system in this stand, and it does not have replacable parts. Quicklock will not stand by their product's advertising. Do not buy this stand. Look to Ultimate Support or On-Stage Stands for better quality products or perhaps even better customer support!For the record, I do own a keyboard stand of theirs, a 2 tier keyboard stand. I purchased this stand to hold an Audio Technica AT4040 that I bought with the stand. Im glad I got a more durable studio boom stand.Please see my customer images of the misleading advertising and the resulting product.E"]}

I decided to purchased Zojirushi based on Amazon reviews. My wife is Japanese. She warned me that Zojirushi is actually not top brand for rice cooker in Japan; she wanted Panasonic or Tiger brand. Well, hundreds of folks on Amazon cannot be wrong, or can it?Poor decision. The rice is too dry and too hard. At first I fill the water to the line in the cooker, the rice is way too dry and and almost inedible. I confirmed using measuring cup that the water line in the cooker is correct, for both white and brown rice. I then added extra wafer, from 0.5 to 1 cup of water. The resulting rice is edible, but close to hard-medium. Surprisingly, the cooker will cook the rice with similar result regardless of how much extra water I add, up to 1 extra cup. If I added even more water, such as 1.25 to 1.5 cups more water than needed, then the rice becomes mush, as expected. I have tried different amount of water, regular vs soft cooking mode, soaking vs not soaking; keep warm vs eating immediately. Doesn't matter. Cannot even get medium to soft rice, which is what we are used.We eat both medium grain white rice and medium grain brown rice. These are Japanese variety rice grown in California. They are very similar to rice served in Japanese restaurant and also used for sushi. We have being using Panasonic rice cooker for past 12 years. The nonstick coating is getting worn out, so we decided to buy new rice cooker. Again, I never have issue cooking any type of rice, short, medium, long grain, etc. I can always adjust the water to get the right softness. But this Zojirushi seems that it is trying to be smarter. It tries to get consistent results even with varying water level. But that result is always toward hard side. There is no way to get medium to soft rice.We eat rice at least 5-6 days each week, so rice cooker is very important to us. Basically, we are going throw this $170 item away and buy new rice cooker.*Update 12/2012*Contacted local Zojirushi service center. The service guy told me this model is very old and he was surprised they are still selling this unit as new. Well, I didn't know. Looking at Amazon reviews, the oldest review was in 2003. So this model is around for 10 years. Have no idea whether that is good or bad. I doubt there is any breakthru technology in rice cooker, so I don't think 10 year old model matters. Our old Panasonic worked great for more than 12 years.In any case, I shipped the unit to Zojirushi. They contact me to instruct me on how to use the different modes: Brown rice, White rice, etc. Yes, I know how to wash the rice, fill with right amount of water, and use the correct mode. Zojirushi sent the unit back to me as-is with the same problem.While the unit is in service, we used our old Panasonic. Cooks rice perfectly. I can adjust the water accordingly to get softer vs harder rice. The rice out of old Panasonic is better than what restaurants' serve. In comparison, the Zojirushi rice is like 1-2 day old rice.This is the last Zojurushi product I will buy."]}

Just thought you might like to know that a double/full size duvet will cover the top of the mattress perfect edge to edge.My guests could not believe it was an airbed.Oh, and I inflated it a week before to give the vinyl time to stretch out and reach it's permanent state. I kept refilling each morning until it stopped losing air. It worked fine after that. If you wish to store them in the bags, then be prepared to have patience to fold them correctly or they will not fit in the bag. Tip is to fold the increase toward the center of the bed and then fold according to instructions. We had to sit on the mattress after folded to release the last bit of air in order to fit in the carry bag. If you do push the crease into the bed, smooth out wrinkles, and then fold.....it will not fit into the bag. Patience is the key.I like them so much, I'm purchasing 2 more for backups."]}

First off, for those that claim it does not work in 1080i, 1080p, you need to set BOTH units to the proper configuration. These cables DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY do it for you. No HDMI cables on the market can do that. In many tv's and dvd players, the HighDefinition mode must be set manually and even when that's done, the highest setting can only be achieved if both of the units support that resolution. For example, my Samsung player defaults to 720p, I have to hold down a button on the remote for it to change to 1080i. Go to Crutchfiled.com for more details, they have a great article on HDMI.I agree like most people here this cable is the real deal. It's hard to believe it's selling for single digit dollars while simliar cables at the retail stores are asking for $40-$120 each.As there are several vendors selling this product, I'm reviewing the one from ClearAV. I bought 3 of them for less than $25 shipped. The cables that came from ClearAV are apparently made by Inspire as it's stamped on the connector. Cables are all black except where the Inspire logo is (blue-green). It's flexible as any normal cable. I've read where some cables are too stiff.Connection tests:I have a brand new Samsung 4665 Full HD 1080p 1920x1080 tv. I connected the HDMI cable to the Sony Playstation 3, they both automatically detected the capabilities of each unit and saw that it was set to 1080p mode. Blu-ray movies were excellent. DVD movies were automatically upscaled to 1080p when I put in an older movie of Saving Private Ryan and the newest Live Free or Die Hard. Audio was transmitted correctly as the TV detected the presence Dolby Digital signal.Second test was with the same TV, but with a different player, a Samsung DVD 1080i player. Connected a 2nd cable to it and the TV automatically detected 1080i. Audio was streamed over correctly as the display screen on the DVD player showed Dolby Digital 5.1. Sound was just like it was before when I used an optical cable. Of course now, the optical cable is no longer needed because of the HDMI cable.With the successful results of the video and audio tests, I can conclude that all digital video and audio signals were apparently streamed over successfully. They appear to meet the HDMI 1.3 specs. I would ABSOLUTELY buy 3 or 10 more of these when I get more HDMI components. What a DEAL!"]}

Again, it would slowly lose air while you were sleeping on it, so by the morning it was definitely softer. And to attempt to find exactly where the leak is coming from is yet another difficult task. If you are lucky enough to find and repair it, great, but we haven't had luck in that department.We then packed it away for about 7 months, brought it back out to use in a guest bedroom and by then the bed would deflate even more noticeably and quicker so you had to fill it during the night and hope that it would hold. But the piece de resistance or, I should say, the final nail in the coffin was one of the seams on the top portion of the mattress popped so there was a huge cylindrical lump running the length of the mattress. If a small child could handle laying on half of the mattress I guess you could live with it, but not an adult. So, the mattress is toast.All in all, we maybe were able to use it a total of 7 or 8 months (and this is with it not holding all of its air during most of this time).

In June 2009 I got this platinum brewer an a present at my Bridal Shower! We were so excited!! Between my husband and I we usually drink about 4 cups of coffee a day... and we are the only people in our household so we really don't over use it.In any case, by February (8 months later) it stopped working correctly. The machine would suck in water, heat it up, and then never push the water out through the grinds to make the coffee! We had descaled it twice so we know it wasnt that and we cleaned it with the paperclip trick but there was nothing doing. Called Keurig, they sent us a replacement.Our second machine lasted until November (9 mos this time). Keurig again offered to send us a knew one since we had also taken good care of the second machine. This time the customer service agent asked if we used hot cocoa or iced tea kcups and said they could clog the machine. We hadn't but made note never to in the future either.While fussing around with the machine my husband realized that if you blow into the little nozzle in the water reservoir that the extra water is meant to come out of and hold your finger over the whole at the bottom of the reservoir you can force the coffee through the machine and into your cup. This seems like a big indicator that there is some kind of faulty mechanical piece in the machine... in all 3 machines we have had sinces they've all died the same way.Our third Platinum brewer is now dead-- another 8 months later. We have opted NOT to call Keurig and get our platinum replaced. We decided that since we have not paid for any of these three brewers as the original was a gift it would be better for us to just pay out of pocket try a different model and let that be the end of it. If the Special Edition brewer dies within a year we are going to write Keurig off completely but for now we are hoping that it is just a mechanical issue in the Platinum.Why else would Keurig be so quick to send out replacements???"]}

I now wish I'd paid more attention to the actual user reviews, as near as I can tell the people writing the magazine reviews must have never actually tried to use this product. Put simply... it doesn't work. Believe the user reviews, this is a bad product.I wanted to transfer some old VHS videotapes to DVD, and I also got the +DV option thinking that it would be a nice way to add Firewire capabilities to my USB 2.0 based system for use with my new Digital camcorder. The Instant DVD box failed miserably to deliver on either of these goals.Using the DV input with my digital camera I had strange artifacts start to appear on the screen. There were weird blotchy sections that started out small, but then grew as the capture progressed until half the screen was covered. While transferring my old analog VHS tapes, certain sections of the tapes would cause the box to completely lock up. When I could get a capture that didn't freeze, I couldn't get a capture where the audio and video would stay in sync. I tried multiple tapes, multiple DVD mastering programs, even multiple computer systems, nothing worked. This was simply making DVD's straight from the captured footage, I wasn't transcoding anything. The only thing that worked for me was taking a nice clean analog signal from my digital camera (since the digital DV capture didn't work.) That was the only thing that stayed in sync, any input that was less than perfect, like 10 or 15 year old VHS tapes, forget about it.I sent several email queries to the ADS Tech support, after giving up on their telephone support after waiting forever on hold. Other than the automated &quot;Well get right back to you as soon as possible&quot; responses, I've heard nothing else from them. That was six weeks ago... and I'm not holding my breath. If you buy this product, you're definitely on your own.I've long since returned my box, and chalked it up to a learning experience. Here are a few things to think about, first of all, do you really want a box that converts straight to MPEG2 format? If you want to change *anything*... clip out a few scenes, add a title screen, join several clips together... you have to reencode the file anyway. By uncompressing then recompressing you're sacrificing quality, and not gaining anything from the built in compression. Also, I didn't realize at the time, but you can get a Firewire card with a cable for almost the same price as just a cable... it's cheap, and much better than spending all the extra money for the +DV option.I now own a Canopus ADVC-100, it's more expensive but worth every penny. More importantly... it actually works! That's much more than I can say about the ADS Tech Instant DVD."]}

Even if you narrow the margins, or select \"none\", the leading edge still has nearly an inch of tape that you must cut off (it prints a mark to show you where). So, at the very least, you'll waste about an inch of tape for every label you make. The cartridges aren't cheap (about $11 and up). They're nice in the fact that you can change the cartridges out before they're empty. This means you can put different widths of tape in for different applications with no trouble or other waste. Changing the cartridge is simple. Each label is printed, cut, and ejected when you're done. It's expensive to operate, but if you can get one dirt cheap like I did, it's kind of worth it."]}

If you are lucky enough to find and repair it, great, but we haven't had luck in that department.We then packed it away for about 7 months, brought it back out to use in a guest bedroom and by then the bed would deflate even more noticeably and quicker so you had to fill it during the night and hope that it would hold.

Adheres to bread and fish like white on rice...even with oil/butter/nonstick spray3.) has a cool colored finish that will chip and look hideous in no time.Seriously, take my word, this is an utter disaster of a product. Either reevaluate whether you need a press, or try another line. If I could turn back time, I'd try Lodge (and they have new colors now to), All Clad, or one of the cheaper cheap pans. This is about the quality of one of those ones priced at $30 or $40. If you're going to lay out $90, go the extra mile and buy something made with quality in mind such as Le Creuset or All Clad or Lodge!"]}

When you contact Intex because your airbed is only five-weeks old and now resembles a mangled balloon animal more so than an airbed, they will politely tell you there are no refunds, warranties, or replacements for you and to buy another one of their products.Normally, I'd just forgo a negative review and just say, \"buyer beware\" and leave it at that. Unfortunately, the \"quality\" of the Intex line of products is so atrociously bad and their \"Customer Service\" is so arrogant and clueless (or perhaps a \"bot\" sending automated, canned email to customers) that I feel it is my ethical responsibility to warn anyone looking for an airbed to stay away from this brand of airbed.

My first thought upon receiving this item was that it's a little flimsy -- the anchors and screws provided with it seemed weak and the construction of the rack itself is a little iffy. Yet it held up well as far as supporting the weight of wet towels and jeans. (The instructions say it will hold 22 lbs.)I ordered this rack because I wanted a place outside my kitchen door (there's a tiny porch there) where I could hang wet dish towels and such (my grandmother always had a line strung on her kitchen porch for this reason). The instructions did not actually indicate it was suitable for outdoor use, but it's plastic and is hung under the eaves so I thought I'd give it a try. But now the white plastic coating is peeling off the rungs and the metal underneath is rusting. It's not very attractive, and I have to be careful to hang things (using clothespins) in such a way that the fabric doesn't get rust stains from contact with the metal.The fact the rack comes with two sets of mounting brackets that it slides on and off of is a nice idea. However, I think too much moving the rack around will eventually cause the brackets to pull out of the wall or the rack itself to break. The 'accordion' mechanism doesn't glide completely smoothly, yet it's held up well over time.This item is basically sturdier than it might look, and it would be great for indoor use.

WONDERFUL PRODUCT - BEST ON MARKET! I cannot tell you all how much I like EVERY Macally Product I own. As an avid Mac user ever since computers were born, I've always stood by Apple Products UNTIL both my G3 iBook and PowerBook Cords - because of the cheap and inferior design, became weak at the point of highest impact and - well, both cords shorted out within the first year and one of the cords actually shot sparks and flames into the air. If I had not been right there to see it, I would not have believed it - yet, I am sure the Fire Department would have. I would have had my entire home in flames as I was working on a large project with flammables everywhere - I was VERY LUCKY! The US Product Safety Commission hasn't done anything to help - I filed reports, and Apple is acutely aware of the problem, (they recalled the G4 cords I believe, not the G3 cords. I still have the singed/burned cords as proof.) Do yourself a favor - watch this around children and pets - and in the meantime - invest $30-$40 for a cord that has lasted me three years and is still going strong. I can't find them locally in Boston, they are always sold out, everywhere. That alone tells you something! Replace your cord before you have a fire - or it shorts out your computer - the surge supressor won't stop it. I love the Macally Price, the solid quality, the compact nature and again, the PRICE. APPLE wanted approx. $100 for another cheap flammable cord. I ALMOST became a Windows user over this, but Macally changed my mind - do not hesitate to buy this gem, or the USB 2.0 mini dock for those iPod users with a 1.0 USB port - I have had my investment returned many times over, and do not need additional FIRE INSURANCE for home now that I have a Macally AC Cord! Buy one before you have a problem! Forget any help from Apple. And - if your original cord is showing wear, or you are losing your charge - those were my first warnings - don't risk your home, or family. It happened to me and I am afraid for those who don't know what happened to me and MANY others! (PS: Tried Kensington at $79.00 and it fell out constantly - improper fit, another waste of $$$)"]}

Less bright and perhaps warmer on the high end, but not as \"bottomy\" or balanced/round on the lower end.But sound aside, I ran into problems when installing these strings as my low E broke at the ball-end after just a few bends and insertion attempts.

Anyway with a few twists and turns, I made a makeshift knot at the end and got the set installed.So for now, I'm still playing on them.

But I loved it otherwise, and still wanted a 900 MHz phone which wouldn't interfere with my 2.4 GHz 802.11b computer network. The ID910 always had great range, the digital 900 MHz quality was great, I wanted a speakerphone, and I needed Caller ID. The ID975 was one of few choices.Thank goodness! I haven't had any problems with battery life, scrambled directory entries, or reliability. The range is at least as good as the ID910, and it still charges an extra battery (the same T23) in the base. Best of all, it improves many annoyances of the ID910: The handset is much lighter. The 3-line LCD display shows both the Caller ID title and number, so you can try to figure out who it is even if Caller ID doesn't know. The jog wheel makes a user manual completely redundant - I've never even looked at the paperwork, but had no problems entering speed dial numbers or changing the ringer. There are two bright red LEDs on the base unit which indicate if someone has called, and if you have any messages (I'm guessing it listens for a stuttering dial tone when you're not on the line).All is not perfect, however. Where the ID910 handset had no real external antenna, the 3-inch extra at the top of the ID975's handset is a step backward. The extra battery charging in the base unit cannot power the base unit during an outage, as the ID910's could. And while the New Call and Message LEDs on the base are very nice, there is no indication on the handset of either. Sony still won't let us control the volume of the ringer. It's either style 1-4 or off (0). But these are minor issues.Overall, I'm very happy with this phone. I hope I don't need a new one until cordless phones and WiFi are no longer competing for the same frequency space. With 2.4 GHz phones becoming popular, good digital 900 MHz phones (most are analog) are becoming hard to find!"]}

Overall we are very impressed with this printer. The quality of the printer hardware, software, user interface, and printing is outstanding. It has a great deal of flexibility when it comes to copying, printing, and scanning (just wish it could FAX).The build quality is excellent and the software for both Mac OS X and Windows is nice. I wish the various pieces were better integrated, but overall impressive. One thing to note, the software of the CD was outdated (especially for OS X) and needs to be updated immediately after being installed.The problem is with network scanning. It is quite slow and cumbersome. I have scanned from the printer (using the printer interface to send to printer) only once successfully. Scanning from the printer is much better, but occasionally the computer cannot find the scanner (both on Mac and Windows).Printing via network is not without its flaws either. First of all it is definitely slower than printing via USB. Which granted it should be, but our previous server had a network adaptor (HP) and printing was almost instantaneous. Once we have had to unplug the printer to get it to start printing. Under Mac OS X it was complaining that I had the wrong ink cartridge installed, while on Windows it kept complaining that the cassette was out of paper (when it was full). Power cycling solved the issue, but it's too soon to say the problem has gone away.Overall I'm happy with the printer which is replacing an HP Deskjet 990c, but believe that there is room for improvement with it's support for network printing and scanning."]}

Going through the cleaning process seemed to help a little for a few days, but the problems would return quickly. It would pump water into the cup normally for a day or two, then it would get really slow to pick up the water and pump a very weak stream. After a week or so, you would get a full cup of coffee about half the time, otherwise the cup would end up about half full. We had to get very creative to actually get a full cup of coffee without wasting a k-cup. Cleaning it involves running an entire reservoir of vinegar throught it, then running at least that much water through it to get rid of the vinegar taste. Not something you want to do once a week. After reading many reviews of customer service, decided it wasn't worth that aggravation. Awful expensive machine to have such basic and commom problems. Maybe a different brand?

The flat bed scanning of photos is not up to my expectations. It is probably ok if you're scanning photos for commercial / non-artistic reasons. I do not believe that this takes the place of a 'decent' photo scanner. I had planned to compromise on getting shorted on the Pro 9 Office software and keep this scanner.

If you try to access your messages remotely using the handset speakerphone, the phone makes a loud click and then the display goes dead and the phone stops working. You then need to place the phone in the charger for 12 - 24 hours to get it to work again. This happens even if the phone is fully charged. Also, battery life is extremely limited for normal handset use. Do not expect to be able to use this phone for more than 15 minutes before you need to charge the handset.Overall, I have to say that this phone is badly designed, is defective and does not operate per its specifications. For the money, $175 plus $85 for the additional handset, I expect a product that works. I will not purchase a Panasonic phone again."]}

I saw the reviews about the made in china sticker... that was the least of the problems. There was 3 sticker labels on the cue. All of them were difficult to remove and all of them left a sticky residue. I also found that the stick is very masculine and the graphite is smooth, but I still needed chalk with this cue (going to get a billiard glove here soon). Overall I am not thrilled.

While the iPod's form factor is much nicer, here's where the Zen is better.Software: A lot of people complain about the Creative Software, but I actually find Creative MediaSource Organizer to have some strengths over iTunes. First, the Zen lets you sync to more than one computer. The iPod is a one way only machine - from computer to player. The Zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources, you can't do this on the iPod (except for a cumbersome work-around using the iPod as a hard drive instead of a player). Second, the \"automatic\" sync on Creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer. Since the iPod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers, the first time I connected my iPod to my laptop, I wiped out the 20GB of music I had transferred from my desktop to the iPod. If the hard drive on your computer should fail, better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone! The Zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player. Third, Creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer. Only thing missing from Creative is a CD burner. Lastly, iPod/iTunes will not play WMA formatted songs. If you have a lot of those, be prepared to convert to MP3.iTunes does what Apple is famous for, makes software that works for the less computer saavy. For those of us that like to tinker, I think Creative offers some advantages.Player controls: Here's where the iPod drives me nuts. The player controls are too easy to hit accidentally. If you happen to push the wrong button, you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in. The iPod also does not let you see what's coming up next on the player. Zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player. It also lets you remove songs from the play order. If you bring up an album, but absolutely hate some of the tracks, the Zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order. You have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the iPod. Lastly, you cannot manage anything on the iPod itself. While you can create a temporary playlist, you can't store it permanently, delete songs, search very easily, etc. None of these features are available because of the iPod's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the iPod that are premanent. Again, the iPod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch, player controls are less functional.I think the iPod versus Zen typifies differences between Apple and Win machines. Win software can be a little cranky, but much more easier to customize to your needs. With Apple, you get a good product, but you get it the way Apple wants you to have it.If I had to do this again, I might get the 40GB Zen. Its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus."]}

Surprise...Surprise...Surprise! My Keurig B70 Plantinum also suddenly stopped working. The water will get hot, but when I push the button to brew it will not pump water out. It does pump water into the boiler but once it's ready for brewing--Nothing! I have done research about how to fix it including hitting the bottom a few times, cleaning the intake under the water container, descaling, using a paper clip to remove possible clogging, using kitchen sink sprayer to force water through the water intake to clear possible clogging, removed the bottom metal plate and removed the plastic pump cover to check for clogging. Nothing has worked so far. Maybe I will eventually figure it out; Then again, maybe the motor has to be replaced?! The bottom line is that this problem shouldn't be happening to so many people. Let's be honest, this brewer is really nothing but an expensive piece of junk. The pump problems effect other Keurig models as well. Just watch the various Youtube videos of people who are giving tips about fixing and you will notice other models are effected. So I expect Keurig to continue to manufacture the same junk--at least until enough people simply give it a pass when it comes to buying its products.I know it's not an easy decision to pass on Keurig because there are very few alternatives, such as Cuisinart's Single Serve Brewing System, which also apparently has similar pump problems. Even the Mr. Coffee Single-Serve version which uses \"KEURIG TECHNOLOGY\" has many negative reviews. So again, it looks like Keurig strikes again and is now making Mr. Coffee look bad.

Even the $299 Breville BKC700XL Gourmet Single-Serve Coffeemaker with Iced-Beverage Function has many negative reviews. Why? Because it too uses KEURIG TECHNOLOGY.My advice if you are going to take a chance with Keurig junk is to save the receipt, save the box and be aware that chances are you will have problems with this coffee maker in about a year or less.

So unless you need all of the features this unit has to offer and you think you'll absolutely have a need for the extra features in the \"near\" future, then I would recommend a $25 labeler from Brother..."]}

I just purchased one of the Zojirushi ns-zcc10 five cup units, and would like to post my comments in order to help others in their buying decisions.If I was to rate the product on just the quality of the finished rice/grains, it would rate a six out of five. Everything that has been cooked has been superb, including the steel cut oats we had this morning. The electronics/controls are very easy to use, including the timer/delayed start. The unit does NOT take an extraordinarily long amount of time to cook rice compared to the old Hitachi we had. If you add the time for the 30 minute pre-soak ( which the Zoj does automatically for best quality), normal cooking time, then the 15 minute steam/rest period, they take close to the same time. You can cut out the soak time using the 'quick' function on the menu.Unfortunately Zojirushi seems to have dropped the ball on a couple items.The big one is no removable steam vent assembly. I cannot believe that other reviews ( that I could find) of this product did not mention this problem/design flaw.Since the vent is fixed in the outer lid, it makes it very difficult to clean properly. There is a rubber gasket that seals it to the removable inner lid that has a lip/ledge above, that is especially problematic.I have been cleaning it with a chopstick wrapped with a damp cloth, but it should be removable to clean under running water at the sink. The manual does not suggest any way to clean the vent, and it DOES get VERY cruddy, especially using the porridge function.The second gripe I have is the use of aluminum on the otherwise very well designed inner lid. The removable lid itself is head and shoulders above some of the others we looked at, like the Tiger and Sanyo. It pivots in two recesses at the bottom, and snaps in at the top. The outer lid will not even close/lock until the inner lid is in place. But why use aluminum that is going to be scratched, is soft and will oxidize over time? I would have paid a couple of extra bucks to have a stainless steel inner lid.Given the excellent quality of the rice this unit makes, I would probably buy it again knowing what I know now. But Zojirushi should/could do better in this price range. We bought this over the comparable Tiger brand cooker, but others may choose differently if clean-up ease means more to them."]}

The switch makes a discernible \"click\" and usually does not return back to LINE1 right away so some of the audio you hope to hear is lost.

I have two AMP100's and they both operate this way. I spoke with Audio Source tech support and they acknowledged this shortcoming and tried to push me to buy the AMP200 which apparently has a time delay that prevents this undesired chopping of content that is connected to LINE1.

I bought the Numark PT01 for the purpose of transfering vinyl albums and 78's to my PC for digital remastering and taking the scratches and noise out and then transfering them to CD's. For the most part, I can't complain. The turntable was easy to set up and use. At this point, I must give information about replacement styluses. Regretfully, Amazon does not sell these, so you'll have to get them from other sources. Don't worry, I'll help you find them. Just Google the numbers you see below and you'll quickly find sites which can sell you these styluses at very reasonable prices.793D7793S3These are special Fansteel numbers which are used to designate the exact styluses needed.The 793D7 is the stylus for 33/45 RPM vinyl disks and uses a diamond tip. The 793S3 is the stylus for wide groove 78 RPM disks and uses a sapphire tip.Now, a word about using this turntable for remastering sound. After you've recorded the record audio to your hard drive, you'll need to adjust the equalizer of your third party recording client so that the 200HZ level is brought down by -12Db. This is because this turntable has an anoying peak at that frequency and especially in the right channel. Also, it's best to turn the volume all the way up on the lineout jakcs (that's right, the volume also effects the auxiliary output jacks which is not a good thing) because you'll want to minimize the amp noise going in to your sound card. Also, you will need to use a lower setting on the track bar for the line input on your card than you may be used to. This is because both headphone jacks and the lineout jacks are fed by the same amplifier and thus the volume; as indicated before, works them all. Barring those factors though, It's a nice little turntable which, provided you're not too demanding of your equipment, will serve well. OF course, it would have been nicer if the cartridge was user replaceable thus allowing the freedom to choose what ever combination of stylus and cartridge you wanted; and, the 200Hz peak in the right channel, which I suspect is the result of the tonearm receiving vibrations from the built in cartridge, would need to be eliminated for me to give it a 5; but, as I said, nice buy if you are not too demanding and are on a tight budget."]}

Panasonic support - which was good - informed me that they were aware of the problem. Apparently the battery wasn't making solid contact so Panasonic sent me two pinky-sized pads with directions to stick them on the underside of the battery compartment. These pads were devised to assist with the seating of the battery and they seemed to work.Fast forward a year later - second issue:The handset is no longer holding a charge more than 20 minutes nor is the phone/clock radio (KX-TGA272). Normally, this would be annoying enough - but it gets better. Both phones go dead while showing 1/3 battery life remaining. This often happens while talking to someone.

You can use it by itself to charge your newer iPhone/iPod, or you can plug another connector into the base of the Kensington connector to both charge the iPhone and pass signal to the connected device (in my case my car stereo). Charging works fine. The stereo pass-through partially works: I have to plug and unplug my phone in twice before my stereo detects the iPhone properly, and sometimes calls that I receive on the iPhone are not automatically sent to the car speakers.Given the cost, I think this is a good product for charging but an awkward solution otherwise.

Apparently it doesn't take much dust or dirt to cause a problem because it did not appear to be very dirty. I'm assuming I'll have to do this every few months.

As others have noted, the line inputs are not terribly sensitive, and my Blue-ray player's line outs put out barely enough; I crank the amp's volume control almost all the way up with most movies. No one has complained of insufficient volume. (Someone wrote that there is a line-in sensitivity adjustment or a max gain adjustment or the like, but I cannot find it.) A preamp with a 3- or 4-volt line out would solve this problem and add needed spectrum control, but at greatly increased cost. You can power either of two pairs of speaker connections but not both; the spec sheet is a little vague on this point. I wouldn't upgrade from this amp before spending at least $2000 on speakers."]}

Some phones I've used blank the display out as soon as you hang up, and I usually don't think of checking until it's too late. The answering machine is the weak link here. Its recording sound is not very good--too &quot;digital&quot; for my taste. It's recording volume also changes noticeably within a sentence, and words or numbers are sometimes distorted and hard to discern (at least for my ears). Also, though it has 30 minutes of recording time, it's only 15 minutes per phone line, even if one phone line gets more calls than the other.

We expressly purchased this printer for its wireless capabilities. We own a lot of Canon products, and I am always impressed by the performance of their cameras. Some printers' quality too. Scanners... that's a different story.So, my main complaint with this printer is that for the price and tauted features is not a solid network performer. It's an USB printer with a quick network job behind it. Here are highlights:1. Software is buggy- network re-configuration should be automatic. Instead, one has to reset the LAN settings on the printer's menu because the included software doesn't want to update new settings (e.g. WEP key change, DHCP server change to new IP, etc.) This applies to wireless.- On OS X 10.4.7 one has to disable the firewall to be able to scan. No documentation shows the TCP/IP or UDP ports needed to be opened so that the scanner can transfer the image to the computer.- printer driver features are hidden behind friendly names like photo-print, tables-and-charts, etc. The \"detailed-settings\" shows a slider with \"fast\" at one end and \"fine\" (print quality) at the other. Detailed settings indeed.- printer does not enter standby after a predetermined time unless all computers on the network are off or standby too. Even the LCD does not turn off.2. The device lacks a dedicated hardware engine with queue support for each function. Some RAM for buffering wouldn't hurt either. So that means one user has to wait until the device is available. Here's a scenario (both users on laptops):- user1 prints or scans- user2 wants to print but is queued- an HP (or true network-enabled printer) would accept both jobs (buffer them) and both users would be free to do whatever else they want. Because this printer doesn't have such features, user2's printjob would go into polling mode (querying the printer every now and then: are you available yet?). This translates into poor CPU usage and eating away battery like crazy on user2's laptop, until his computer can finally send the job to the printer.3. Wireless connectivity is extremely bad. The access point is about 9ft away from the printer, link quality is at 63% and consequently, the super-fast advertised printing speed of 30ppm translates into about 2ppm (black-only, medium-quality prints). Forget about color photos, they take bloody ages. USB or LAN printing is obviously faster. LAN printing still suffers from the same queue problems.On the bright side, technical support is handled by friendly people. Unfortunately, their most typical answer is Windows-like: \"did you reinstall the drivers?\" although they have a dedicated Mac team for driver and application software development.Okay, enough with the negatives.1. Scan quality (from film negatives, pun intended) is great. Scan from printed pictures, magazines, books, etc. is good too.2. Print quality is great. Individual monitoring of ink levels is a very nice touch.3. Duplex-printing. Yee! Enough said.So, would you pay the $100 difference between the MP800 and MP800R in light of the above? I definitely wouldn't have done it, if I knew beforehand the above problems. Instead, I would've looked elsewhere. But all reviews tend to be so simplistic, and so they also are misleading.If the people from Canon care enough, they could fix this with updated software (I can think of several ways of doing this). Unfortunately, queue support requires hardware changes.Hope above helps.Virgil"]}

So, I wouldn't call that bad because there is usually enough ambient noise to cancel it out. The wide angle isn't very wide angle, but you do get a lot of great non-digital zoom. The digital zoom gets pixelated pretty quickly but would you expect otherwise? You can only access some of the features with the viewing screen open and in bright outside light the picture is washed out and you can't really see the menus very easily. The fade in and out features were fun but somewhat cumbersome to use.The ugly: Do not buy this camera if you intend on using it to take still pictures to the MMC. There are two problems. Check out the specifications and you will see that the CCD chip has only about 250,000 or so effective pixels. But, the real killer is the 8-bit color. There are two resolution modes, fine and normal. The instruction manual says the fine mode can be used for taking pictures for printing out and the normal for sending over the Internet. In the fine mode, a perfectly blue sky comes out mottled shades of blue, pink, and purple. For other, less uniform colors, the effect is worse. With the low number of pixels and 8-bit color, this feature is pretty much useless if you are used to using a good film SLR camera or a high pixel digital camera.Overall: I gave it four stars because it's a really good minicam with great Canon optics, many useful features, and ease of use, but I was really disappointed with the still picture feature. I can't believe Canon would even include such a poor quality feature. If you want both good digital video and pictures, you probably need to look at different brands with megapixel CCDs, which are available for a comparable price."]}

I must admit that I am VERY disappointed. I LOVE the concept of this machine, but apparently Keurig is plagued with consistent problems with this machine and others. I have had my B70 for less than a month and it's already defective. It started shutting itself off even before it would attempt to start to brew. At first I dismissed it to user error but during this last week, it's been shutting itself off in the middle of a brew cycle - the display goes to \"not ready\" and then it just completely powers off! I double checked the settings and the auto off is disabled so it's not user error. I have used bottled water from day one, so Keurig is not going to get away with telling me that I need to descale the thing. I'm also disappointed with their customer service - like other reviewers, I too am getting the run around. I called Customer Service on Thursday and after spending several minutes giving my name, address, phone number, email address, purchase date and serial number (by the way, I had already registered my unit online so I found myself wondering why I was having to provide all of this information again on the phone) I was told \"gee, we sold thousands of them on QVC so our call volumes are very high right now.\" So, after providing all of the information to Customer Service and describing the problem I was then told that I must speak to a \"technician\" for further assistance. After waiting on hold for several minutes I was informed that there wasn't a technician available and assured that someone would call me back within 48 hours. As you may suspect, it's been 24 hours and not a single attempt from a technician to contact me has been made (I have caller ID so I know that no attempt to contact me has been made). I attempted to call Keurig again Friday afternoon to see if perhaps one of these so called \"busy technicians\" was available, but I was finally told that they all went home for the day. As you may have seen with other reviewers, their technicians work Monday to Friday until 5 or 5:30pm ET. I also attempted to call the third party vendor that I ended up inadvertently ordering this unit from through Amazon (Chef's Corner Store). I called them at 2pm Pacific on Friday and they didn't answer their phone. Their voice mail indicated that if I was calling during business hours (of course, their business hours weren't provided in the message) I'd receive a call back, However, no attempt was ever made to return my call.Because I do love this machine, I find myself continuing to give Keurig a chance, although I'm fairly confident that a replacement machine probably won't last very long either. From what I've read, most folks can't seem to get one to last more than about 1 1/2 years. As with other reviewers, this is very disappointing considering the cost of this machine - it's almost $200. You'd expect better quality and much better customer service for that price. And if you look at other negative reviews, you'll see that this problem has gone on for years.My minor disappointment with this machine is the lack of mug warmer. I have my B70 set for the maximum temp which is 192 degrees. It's hot when it first brews, but with no mug warmer (the machine simply has a little drip tray plate) the coffee cools off quickly. To get around this problem, I purchased a mug warmer and simply replaced the drip tray with the mug warmer - that way I can brew a cup of coffee but don't feel like I have to rush back in to the kitchen to get to it before it starts cooling off. I'm quite surprised, actually, that Keurig hasn't designed a built in mug warmer. I think it would be an ingenious idea!I finally received a call from one of the \"busy technicians\" today. This gal could not wait to get me off the phone. She didn't even ask me to descale the thing telling me that she agreed that it's been too soon to have to need to descale it. I found it fascinating that she mentioned the descaling first - this seems to be a canned response from Keurig and their answer to all of their problems (see other reviews). She did ask if I'd used the special filter that allows consumers the option of using their own coffee instead of one of the prepackaged K-Cups - implying that this is the cause of a machine that has decided to shut itself off all the time.I received my new replacement B70 unit on Thur 1/14/2010 and installed it on Friday. Low and behold, yesterday I had powered it on to make a cup a coffee and returned about 10 mins. later to find that the machine was powered off. I thought for sure this was simply user error. Unfortuantely, I turned it on again today, and after making a low hum for about two minutes, it didn't even draw water in to the back of the unit, it just powered off all by itself. I turned it back on, it did it again. I turned it back on a third time and then it finally pumped the water and brewed the coffee. I SIMPLY CAN NOT BELIEVE THIS - this is my second, replacement machine, shipped to me directly from Keurig, and it's not even a week old and the darn thing is doing exactly what the first one was doing. So I'm on the phone with customer service again, this time they couldn't find me in their system because the technician who sent me the replacement machine put my middle name on the replacement order, and put my middle name first. So after spending far too long with this customer service rep (I had to spell out gmail.com), she tried to get me to a technician - and of course, their technicians were all busy. So once again, I'm waiting for 24-48 hours for a technician to call me back so that they can tell me that yes, by all means, this machine is defective too, and gosh, we'll get you another one out right away.Well, as expected, I'm now on my third Platinum B70 and it too only lasted days. Same problem as the first two. The only good thing is that after all of my complaining, someone at Keurig finally cared and reached out to me, first by email, then by phone. Apparently Josh O'Leary really exists! The disappointing thing is that he'll lie to your face and tell you that they've really only had a small number of machines with problems even though there are countless complaints on Amazon and on Keurig's own website when you look at the feedback for all of the models combined - it's simply a global issue for them. And now mysteriously, the Platimum B70 is out of stock at Keurig until April. I'd like to think that they're pulling them in an attempt to actually fix the problem before reintroducing the B70's back to the market.UPDATE 6/28/2011: Miraculously, I am still on my third B-70 which I've managed to limp along with since the day I pulled it out of the box. As mentioned above, it too was defective within days of removing it from the box, just like the other two, so I immediately called Customer Service who sent me yet another one - my fourth - which is still sitting in its box ready to be pulled out when this one becomes too much of a burden to put up with. This third one continues to either short brew (not brew the amount it's set to), brew a cup and then immediately shut off, start brewing and shut off mid brew, over brew, or just plain try to brew (the display indicates \"brewing\"), make a lot of noise, not brew anything, and then shut off. I have used spring water or purified water from the very first day I started using these machines and descale them religiously, but it makes no difference. I've decided that when I simply can't get this third one to brew without several attempts, I'll junk it and break out the fourth one.I'm very disappointed to see reviews from other buyers a year or so after my purchase, continuing to have the same problems. I simply do not understand why after all this time, this manufactuer still can not get this machine to work consistently for more than a few months at a time, especially for the price they're charging. Oh, and yes, it is interesting that Customer Service has no interest in receiving the defective ones back. They had me send the first one back, but after the second one died, they said they didn't care what I did with it or the third one. And I'm left with the dilemma of determining how to properly dispose of a coffee maker.On a positive note, I disagree with those who indicate that the coffee is weak - I've tried several of the varieties and like most of them - and I have certainly NOT had any problems with weak coffee and I have been brewing my coffee at the 9.25oz size. I simply can not understand how anyone thinks that the coffee is weak. I've had enough Starbucks coffee to tell you that the Bold and Extra Bold K-Cups live up to what you'd expect!I also completely disagree with those who indicate that the Keurig is noisy - sure it gets a little noisy right near the end of a brew, for all of about five to ten seconds, but truthfully, my microwave buzzer and stove hood are louder than the Keurig for goodness sakes. I don't believe it makes any more noise than a standard coffee maker.The convenience of this machine is wonderful - it is so nice not to have to clean out coffee filters full of used coffee grounds and clean out a coffee pot with hours old coffee. The coffee is really good and it's hot (if you drink it right away or put a mug warmer under your mug). The B70 is stylish and it's easy to operate, when it works. And that is the crux of it all - WHEN IT WORKS......."]}

Replacement catridges are expensive, but this printer scored well vs other inkjets in cost/page on PC Magazine's review. I use a HP Laserjet 1200 for volume printing where color is not critical.

Bought this wireless card shortly before upgrading an XP computer to Windows 7. I guess I was naive -- I believed the claims that hardware that works on Vista will also work on Windows 7. When I ran the upgrade advisor, it told me to go to the company website and download an updated driver to install after the upgrade. I did so, but could only locate a driver for Vista. Worth a try, I thought. However, the install program would not even start on my upgraded machine. I contacted tech support at MSI several days ago by email to find out if an updated driver is in the works -- and did not even receive an automated acknowledgment of my inquiry. They have not responded to date.As for the XP part -- installed it on a computer that is not far from my router, although on another floor. Have always had poor signal using an old laptop with a wireless card in that room, but this card picked up a good signal, with nice connection speed. Instructions were scant and did not explain the options offered in the setup program. I couldn't get onto my network using the proprietary software program that comes with the card -- partly because it's more complicated than it needs to be, asking questions about the network specifications that the XP configuration utility doesn't require, and whose answers I didn't know. The install program offers the option of using the wireless zero configuration program, but I didn't realize that is the native utility in XP, so did not initially select it. I had to activate the XP utility and use it to connect successfully to my network.If I were using this on an XP computer, I would be giving it 5 stars (although I only used it for a few minutes). However, with the poor support and compatibility issues I'll give it 3 stars. I sent it back, and have ordered a card that is listed in the byzantine Windows 7 compatibility center (where apparently you cannot search by model number) at Microsoft."]}

Let's get this out of the way first: I took off one star because of the quality. It's not very good. Everything is clear and I actually appreciate the minimalist approach (no distractnig backgrounds and only one hooper to watch), but the picture is pretty grainy at times and could use some serious touch up. So it isn't a perfect product, but I'm not getting an instructional DVD for the pretty picture quality.Personally, I have a handful of years of experience hoooping. I actually make my own hoops for that purpose, so I went ahead and skipped to the second DVD, which features three things I've been having issues learning: Shoulder hooping, leg/knee hooping, and the vortex (it's not referred to as the vortex on the video, but it's basically a continuous corkscrew they go over towards the end of that section).What I really loved about this DVD was the no frills instruction. They don't make up cutesy fun names. The names make sense and most of the terminology you'll see is the same or very similar as you'll hear in hoop communities and on youtube. This is helpful if you want to reference other videos online in addition to this one, and I suggest you should. Hooping is an art and it can be very different from person to person. You may find another explanation for a move that just clicks with you and helps you finally get something you've been struggling with.In addition, while this is all available for free on youtube, there is the benefit of having the moves neatly organized so you don't have to spend forever trying to figure out what moves you want to learn, in what order, and what they are actually called so that you can find them.I know they tell you not to hoop with the video at first, but I did, for about an hour. I found myself able to pull off and sustain most of the moves I'd been struggling with. There's also a troubleshooting bit after each section that aptly covers the most common problems with each move.The narrator's voice is fairly pleasant and not overly cheerful. There is a small bit after each section that shows one of the women free-styling the moves you just learned, and her expression is a little forced cocky and can be a bit irritating, but that's it.All in all, I was really impressed and felt like a great deal of information was aptly covered. For the price I paid, I think it was extremely worth it and will definitely be purchasing the next DVD."]}

After reading a number of other reviews, I wasn't sure that they were talking about the same phone I recently bought. Here's why I bought the phone and my take on the quality of the features that were most important to me:-- Voicemail Waiting Notification: I use the voicemail service provided by my local phone company. With my old phone, I had to pick up and dial to find out if I had a voicemail waiting. This phone has a small red (LED) light on the top of the phone that will notify you when a message is waiting. Unlike the expereince of some other reviewers, this has worked great for me.-- Speakerphone on the Base: I work from home from time to time and need a speakerphone for conference calls. This phone has a speakerphone on the base unit and also has a mute button. The quality is decent, not fantastic. But if you are just looking for a fantastic speaker phone, you're buying from Polycom, not VTech. I found that the microphone on the VTech is very sensitive (you don't need to speak loudly) and the quality of my voice actually improved by moving the phone a little further away from me while talking.-- Ability to Add Additional Phone(s): In our house, the fact that you can walk around with a cordless means you leave it places that are inconvenient to get to when the phone rings. As a result, I wanted the ability to add a second or third phone WITHOUT needing another phone jack since we aren't wired in many rooms. The VTech is supposed to allow the addition of up to 3 additional phones, without needing additional phone jacks. (I recently ordered a second handset, but have not received it yet.)-- Call Quality: I wouldn't notice if I couldn't hear a pin drop on the other end of the phone... I don't need that level of quality, I just want something that doesn't breakup or sound noticably bad. The VTech handset seems to have a quiet &quot;hum&quot; when I use it next to my computer, but otherwise it has been very clear in other areas of the house. Overall, the quality is fine.The phone has some other standard features that you can read about in the product description like stored numbers, last number redial, call waiting caller id, multiple ring tones, etc, etc. The features are similar to what you might expect on a cell phone today, and all seem to work fine.The battery life does seem a little short but if you are like me and tend to put it in the charger overnight at least once every two days, I don't think you'll have a problem.Overall, I'd say the phone is good for the price if you're interested in the features that I mentioned. If you don't mind spending another $50 - 100$ for a similar system w/ 2 phones, check out the AT&amp;T product."]}

It might be less noticeable when used for main or surround speakers, but it sounded horrible on a subwoofer and made the amp seem cheap.Besides the issues I mentioned, it worked fine and the sound quality was adequate (when it would stay on long enough to hear it).I ended up disconnecting it because it wasn't working out and decided to use an older stereo receiver that can be turned on/off with my Harmony remote."]}

He took a seat on it and said he thought it would be OK. I took the plunge and laid down on the mattress - it did feel kinda like a water bed (without the squishy water noise).After his first night, he said he slept comfortable and all through the night. I thought that was a good sign, of course, I couldn't tell if he was just being polite. He continued to report that he slept well on this air mattress, so as he was preparing to leave, I asked him to leave the air mattress inflated, that I would take care of it after he left. Well, I really wanted to sleep on it after he had left. So after washing the sheets, I laid down that night for a test drive of this mattress. I was surprised how well I did sleep - I did have some sleep disturbances, but nothing that I didn't fall right back asleep from. It certainly isn't my regular mattress, but it is definitely something that will work for the short term.I've had several house guests since the first to sleep on this Intex air mattress, and each has reported that they have gotten good rest on this mattress.

I read through most of the reviews on this product, and I have experienced many of the problems/annoyances that people have addressed. Thanks to the newsgroups I found that I had purchased the initial release. The newer release solves many of the annoyances, but battery life still suffers and range would depend on the environment.The old version is commonly purchased as a refurbished unit... The new version has a red/silver and black box, and has been offered since the 1st or 2nd quarter of 2000.Here is a summary of problems people have written about, that were corrected in the new version:Power outage - If your power goes out you will not lose your messages, directory, pin code, etc. I've had my set unplugged from the wall for about an hour, and the only thing lost was the date/time. You can reset this yourself, or when a call is received, it will take the date/time from the caller ID.Directories - The new version of the phone allows you to transfer directories from the handset to the base and vice versa.Transfer/Pickup of calls - On the old version, you had to transfer a call from one handset to another. You could not pickup a line that was in use. This was particularly annoying when you had both Siemens phones and regular phones in the house. The new version allows you to join a line, which overcomes this problem.Now to address other problems, I have never had problems with calls dropping unexpectedly when in range. We've been able to take the phone out of the house and almost a city block away. Like a digital cellular phone - you don't get static, you just lose the call. Also, I've never had a problem with going out of range &gt;in&lt; my house. I live in a typical ranch, with the base at one end and have used the handset at the opposite end.Call quality has usually been good, and very few times I had a garbly effect like that which you would experience on a digital cell phone. Running the microwave usually caused this problem. Otherwise, I have 2-line GE ProSeries speakerphones in the kitchen and bedroom, and I've been told that the Siemens speakerphone and handsets sound much better than the GE's.I've used this phone while working on my laptop, which has a wireless network card that operates on the same frequency. I can hear a slight intermittant popping, which is apparently when the spread-spectrum overlaps the other devices signal. But, both devices remain usable.The answering machine and caller-id work great. You can access the answering machine with the handset or remotely, and you have complete control over replaying and deleting messages. The annoying thing is that the numbers you need to press to do simple things, like play a message, don't make sense. When calling remotely, the voice prompting's first selection is to change the outgoing message. When the heck would I want to do that? But, once you read the book and memorize the buttons, accessing your messages is a breeze.The handset has a headset jack and a belt clip. I've plugged a headset in and clipped the phone to my pants, and off I went gabbing on the phone while doing housework, etc. (The base has a headset jack too.)The battery life sucks, honestly. That is my biggest complaint. As long as you put the phone in the cradle every night, you shouldn't have a problem. You can also purchase additional batteries, which can be charged in a special compartment in the cradle, but changing the batteries is clumsy.The other annoying thing is when I receive a call and put it on hold, and then answer it with a non-Siemens phone. I noticed that the call never goes &quot;off-hold&quot; on the Siemens, and there is a &quot;holding tone&quot; that continues to play in the earpiece until the call is released from the Siemens.I've had the new version for about 7 months. It's not perfect, but I'm not disappointed. It's lightweight, full of features like caller-id with name on the handsets, and I can setup a handset as a baby-monitor. You can also call other handsets internally on the system, like having an intercom system in your house. Realize that this system is like having a business-class telephone system in your house, and business phone systems don't cooperate with regular phones either."]}

In 2009, after using it occasionally for 6 years, I finally started feeding sheets of paper with oil on them into the machine to make sure it stayed lubricated. It has seen increasing amounts of usage since then and has handled what I've thrown at it with aplomb, as long as what I fed it didn't stall it. The few times it has stalled, the reverse button has cleared the jam. Now and then I have to take some needle-nosed pliers (aka my Leatherman) and pull paper out of the extreme left and right edges of the rollers. No big deal.Over the last 5 months, I have been going through 3 filing cabinets and many boxes of old documents and shredding almost everything in them. I've passed literally thousands upon thousands of bills, receipts, statements, tax returns, etc through this thing with nary a hiccup as long as I kept a bottle of oil (I've been using hair clipper oil) handy to keep things lubed up. The machine was made before it was common to add credit card shredding capabilities to shredders, and I'd deduct half a star for that if I could. To be fair, I've never tried to shred a credit card, and it would probably do it, but I don't want to take the chance of breaking it by using it for something it wasn't designed to handle. In any event, for the price and the reliability that I have personally experienced, I'm very happy to have bought this shredder.

I contacted HP's tech support and went through all their power down and resetting tests which of course did nothing to help with the problem. I was told I could return it for a refurbished one but opted to return it to the local Staples store where they offered me a new one if I agreed to purchase an extended warranty for $29.99 in early February. I have now had the new printer for about a month and a half and am now having the same problem with an \"Out of Paper\" error when there is plenty of paper in the tray, and am having to manually feed the paper again. I contacted Staples and told them of the problem, and when asked what I would like to do replied that I would like to exchange for a different model and be credited the full price of the printer plus the cost of the extended warranty. I was told that I would not be credited for the extended warranty because that is what allowed me to return the printer itself. I find it ridiculous that I paid for a warranty that only allows me to return a product which has an inherent design problem. I plan on contacting HP customer support and if they do not offer me a full refund will never buy another HP product again.I would probably have rated this at 4 stars if I had not had this problem.

My prior cordless was a VTECH, that lasted for about 4 years, at which point the display became too hard to decipher. I purchased the Uniden for its sleek lines, many features, and brightly lit display.The speaker phone is superb with excellent voice clarity. The phone illumitates brightly when an incoming call arrives. A mute feature allows one to stop the ringing while the call is coming in, if it is a call you wish not to answer. As a two line phone, you are able to designate which line will be operational when picked up from the handset. The belt clip is really sturdy and doesn't feel like it will break off.I find the range of distance could use improvement. My old Vtech could get me down to my mailbox, about a 30 second walk away, but the Uniden will drop the call. Another thing I've noticed is that when a voice mail is left for me, the indicator light on the phone should be flashing, but isn't always. Still trying to figure that one out.Oh yeah, when a call comes in on Caller ID from another area code, it doesn't appear with a 1, which is required where I live. If I want to save it in the phone book, the stored Caller ID number is useless, unless I go in and edit the entire number to include a 1. Its not intuitive, as I've tried a number of times but still haven't been able to add the 1.Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the phone, and hope to work out these little bugs in the coming weeks."]}

I purchased the Wowpad about six months ago for a smooth lacquer desk where I didn't want a thick mousepad bulking up the surface and getting ugly wrist dirt wear marks. Six months later, I like this mousepad but with a few reservations. Here's a recap of my experience:1) Background texture - Though the instructions suggest cleaning the pad every week, I went six months before the pad started to slip. However, I have the perfect environment for the Wow!Pad - my desk is perfectly smooth (no wood, leather, or other surface texture whose debris might adhere to the surface) and I don't have pets, children, or food at my desk. If I had any of those aggravating factors, I'm sure I'd be cleaning the pad a few times a month and I definitely wouldn't recommend this for a dorm room. However, cleaning was a cinch. I ran some water over the back and used my fingers to rub off some of the dust. A few seconds later it was dry and on my desk again - good as new. Overall, I'd much prefer to clean this mousepad a little bit more frequently than deal with a thick traditional mousepad that never quite gets clean and whose spongy texture remains soggy for at least a day after cleaning.2) Design - I was hoping for something far sleeker than the Wow!Pad and envisioned a semi-transparent mousepad that would camouflage into my white desk surface and fit into a minimal Apple aesthetic. From the pictures, I hoped that the concentric grey circles might be a shadowy artifact. However, they are even more pronounced in person and the mousepad is gray, not white, overall. Furthermore, the gold \"Wow!Pad Microthin.com (R) Patented\" 2-inch logo is not subtle. It is the biggest logo on my desk - I even tried scraping it off but it's permanently adhered within the surface. If the logo were a little bit prettier, I'd probably be more forgiving. However, I purchased this mousepad primarily for aesthetics and in that regard, I am disappointed. Though I'm a little bit of a design nut, my colorblind husband even commented that the mousepad seemed \"off\" when compared to the rest of our desk setup.3) Functionality - it's perfect. I have a laser mouse and though I'm not a fan of the pad's gray circles and grid marks, they work flawlessly. The size is great and even for 5-8 hours of daily coding & graphics work, I've never had any issue with movement or resolution. I don't know if the batteries have lasted longer but the lifespan certainly hasn't gotten worse.Overall, I've been very happy with the mousepad though I still keep my eye out for better-designed alternatives. I'd definitely recommend this to friends to use at work and potentially for the home too if they have a clean desk setup that only needs occasional dusting."]}

This little radio has been a great help, considering the sometimes strange and quickly changing weather we seem to have in eastern Tennessee. I bought this radio because of its portability and SAME feature. A year later, it is still a handy tool to have but it does have some fairly large drawbacks.The SAME alert feature is reassuring in times of bad weather. We do have severe weather fairly frequently during warmer months, and I can say that I have felt more secure having a radio with the ability to warn me of severe weather in my own county. The codes for individual areas are available on the NOAA website: simply find the correct page for your state and a list of counties or regional/metro areas will be listed with their SAME codes. You have the ability to allow all warnings (within the broadcast area) to activate the radio on setting one. If you want more specific warnings for a certain county (or multiple county/regional area), simply put in the SAME code for the first area on setting two and go from there if you have more than one code to put in. This ability lets you get weather warnings from the direction in which the severe weather is traveling from. Another use for this feature is to use the additional SAME slots for traveling without erasing your original county codes.The drawbacks of this radio include battery life problems and ease of use. The radio eats through AA batteries quite quickly, potentially leaving you without the use of the radio during inclement weather. We have a set of rechargeable batteries that we use with the radio. We also don't power up the radio unless there is an indiciation of bad weather to save power. It does function well as a regular weather radio, but with the poor battery life it makes it more difficult to justify popping back in the batteries just to listen to the outlook. Ease of use in programming the radio is also a big drawback. Trying to set up not only the correct band for your local weather radio (available on the SAME pages mentioned before) and also setting up SAME county/regional codes can be very trying, especially given the need to continually reset them up due to poor battery life.I think the unit has an AC adapter port but the unit doesn't come with an adapter. If one could obtain an adapter then this would be a great home weather tool. Otherwise, this radio is still a good choice but make sure to invest in a set of rechargeable batteries and a permanent list of SAME codes to keep nearby."]}

The slightest dampness will cause soluble FTPs to run. On the otherhand, permanent FTPs (such as Sharpies) are pretty permanent and hard to remove. The ink in FTPs (whether water soluble or permanent) fades after a few weeks in sunlight.ADVANTAGES OF CHINA MARKERSChina markers will mark anything, with a little elbow-grease can be completely wiped off any non-porous surface. China markers do not fade in sunlight.USESChina markers are ideal for marking china (dishes and bowls), e.g., prices at a garage sale. They can be used for decorating picture windows, or prices on used cars for sale. They are particularly good with garden tags to record what you've planted. They are good for labeling paper packages and plastic or glass containers of food for storage in a refrigerator. They can be used as simple crayons for art projects. Speaking of which, the marks are just as difficult as crayons to remove from fabrics.FIXING SCRATCHED CDs/DVDsHowever, I purchased them for fixing scratched CDs. I had purchased a kit (a wax pencil and a cloth) years ago for the purpose, but can no longer find the kit for sale. If your disk has a single scratch which is causing a problem---mark over the scratch with black china marker, and then wipe the excess off with a clean cloth, rubbing across (not along) the scratch. And miraculously, the CD will play, most of the time. Apparently the black pigment in the scratch prevents extraneous reflections which cause the problems. This doesn't always work, but at least you've done no damage to the CD, and you can always try a more vigorous method.If your CD/DVD has many scratches, you may want to cover the entire surface with the black marker marks, then wipe off. If that doesn't work, another method is to scrub with toothpaste. Scrubbing with toothpaste will dull the surface with hundreds of shallow scratches, but may remove the slightly deeper scratches which are causing the problem. A special kit may be a better solution if the black wax pencil doesn't work.Maxell CD/CD-ROM Scratch Repair Kit"]}

This instrument is easily the nicest guitar you're going to buy at this price point. Yes, it is assembled in China, but the workmanship of this instrument is quite good, and it is a nice, even, balanced guitar. It sounds nice, has good projection, a good tone, and, a nicely balanced sound. This guitar is absolutely ideal for fingerstyle playing. It is definitely an underrated and unappreciated model in the Epiphone line of guitars. This instrument has quickly become my favorite. The factory set up is decent, right out of the box, and the neck is smooth and comfortable.My only complaints are as follows:1. The strings that the factory uses. I tuned the guitar up, played it for 10 minutes, and my fret-hand fingers had become as blackened as if I had run my fingers across the dirty flue of a chimney. But, that is a quick, inexpensive, and easy problem to fix.2.The lacquer is a bit strong, but I'm sure that will dissipate in time.Otherwise, this instrument plays and sounds like a much more expensive instrument, and is an exceptional value for the price.As many players, after a while I may want a different instrument, or want to \"upgrade\". That won't be so with this guitar. It's definitely a \"keeper\". It's perfect for the type of playing that I do (country, blues,gospel, and contemporary rock such as Counting Crows, Train, etc.).In grading this instrument, and I have played many in all price ranges, I have to give this instrument a solid \"A\". It really is a surprisingly high quality instrument that Epiphone could easily sell for a higher price.Any interested players should pick one of these up before Epiphone decides to discontinue this little gem.Update (September 6, 2012):I've been playing this guitar for 1 1/2 years now, and I am even happier with my purchase. The top is really \"opening up\" on this instrument, and it projects nicely, and has a great tone. I put a bone nut and saddle onto this instrument, put some Tusq bridge pins onto it, and have been using D'addario phosphor Bronze strings on this instrument. This has helped with the volume and tone greatly.This guitar sounds great, better than some that I've played in the $ 1,000-$ 1,200 range (after the upgrades that I've made to the instrument), and is an instrument that I will never part with (voluntarily, anyway).I give this instrument my highest recommendation."]}

This is probably the nicest home phone available. I'll break it down to what I like and dislike about it:Likes:+ Great styling, small size, good weight, comfortable to hold, ergonomic.+ Easy to use menu system. I was able to figure everything out in just minutes before I even opened the manual.+ Like previous VTechs with CID, it has the ability to dial and end calls like a cellphone.+ Speakerphone in handset, it gets plenty loud enough.+ Backlit LCD makes it much easier to read than non-backlit phones.+ Backlit keypad, a practical feature that is omitted from other &quot;high-tech&quot; phones like Cybergenie, Engenius, Siemens, etc.+ Full dot-matrix display which helps readability.+ 3-full lines for CID, much better than my previous 2-line VTech 900MHz.Dislikes:- Background noise. My phone picks up a low-level static/noise/buzzing even with all computers and electronics turned off. It's not loud or disturbing, I only hear it when no one is speaking. My 900MHz VTechs were crystal clear in comparison.- Durability of finish. The store displays I've seen all have spots where the silver paint wore off of the handset and base. Mine is still looking new, but I'm very careful when I set it back in its base.- Slower response than my 900MHz phones. When the phone is idle and I pick up and press a button, there is a slight delay. It's just a few milliseconds, but noticeable.- Lack of tactile feedback in the keypad. I noticed some display models had a lot more tactile feedback than mine. I guess VTech must have changed something between the first phones and mine.- Lost the side-mounted volume buttons that my 900MHz VTech had. Putting volume into a soft key was a step backwards, even Nokia added the volume buttons onto the side of their cellphones.There is a lot I think VTech could do to refine it, like scroll up/down hard buttons, ability to mark memory entries as &quot;Global&quot; and have them sync with other handsets, and mapping some of the memory entries to the numeric &quot;speed-dial&quot; numbers. However, so far as home phones go, this is one of the best I've seen. Not the best in sound quality, but when features and styling are taken into account, definitely a top choice. The &lt;$... price tag makes it worthwhile. The only thing that would be much better is if Nokia made a land-line home version of their popular 6160 cellphone."]}

A couple of years ago I was looking for a stereo amp to power 8 sets of ceiling speakers in my home. I had already installed impedance matching volume controls so I was not overly concerned about the amp getting dragged down with a 2 ohm or similar load. My choices narrowed down to an Onkyo M-282 or the Audiosource Amp 100.The Onkyo put out 100 watts per channel and the Audiosource did 50 watts at 8 ohms. Nod to the OnkyoThe Onkyo had an Amplfier Protection Circuit and the Audiosource had a fuse. We will come back to this point.The Onkyo was $200 and the Audiosource was about $90 at the time. Nod goes to the Onkyo because it just had to be better at the price difference.Last week, after just over 2 years, the Onkyo rolled over and quit. After way too much time on the phone at Onkyo Customer support, it became clear to me that there was no repair route that would be less than the cost of a new Onkyo; the culprit was the \"Amplifier Portection Circuit\".Since the Onkyo was now a doorstop, I decided to try the Audiosource 100 and since they were 50 watts at 8 ohms or 160 watts bridged, I bought two from Amazon.

So I got a cheap Coleman air mattress to use on top of the futon at night. That way I figure I can still have a \"couch\" during the day. Worked pretty well for about 2 weeks till it got a huge hole on a seam. The repair patch was useless, so I decided to find a new air mattress online.The price for this one was perfect, and the reviews were possitive so I took a chance. I choose free shipping and was amazed it only took a day and a half for me to recieve it, instead of the 8-10 days my order said to expect. It took less the 2 minutes to inflate, and is extremly comfortable.The cord stores right inside a compartment built into the pump, kinda like a battery compartment. Speaking of batterys, It also has a spot built in to inflate using a hand pump, incase electricity is unavailable. Also, the repair patch included is way better then the cheap little sticker included in my original Coleman air bed, although I hope to never have need of it.At first I was concerned with the height, being taller the my old one was, but I decided to take a chance and order it anyway. Actually on top of the futon, it is the same height as a regular mattress and boxspring, so I lucked out on that as well.I'm definately going to order a queen size for my bf and I to use for camping and Burning Man.

I did a better job drilling and making the screws flush myself. At that point I finally gave up because it was not worth the trouble. The deal breaker was when installing it, I felt the entire thing when put together was just too heavy even though I had a sturdy desk. Over time I was worried that it would not be stable enough, sliding it in and out on a daily basis. Even though it did not work out for me it might for someone else and its not entirely all cons.

I think it's not an issue for most people because most people don't have a belly as big as I have and I think the stiffness helps keep it from rolling down. This was a minor issue for me and after a full day at the park I came home with no chafing so I was so happy with them and I will order a few more!!"]}

(I recommend this strongly.) Everything installed and worked beautifully. The download of the 3 software programs took less than 4 minutes on my HP Pavilion with XP. I found the instructions were clear, however not all the functions are explained in detail. The \"LP Recorder\" is pretty straightforward. I did modify one setting here - they recommend setting \"auto stop\" as its supposed to sense silence between tunes. On my first album attempt, I found it shut off after one tune. Once I unchecked that option, I found recording a complete album works smoother. The options on the tool bars of all 3 programs are not explained in the user manual - you're on your own. \"Wave Corrector De-Click\" is a gem! I had one album that was quite scatchy - this made it sound like brand new. I had a few problems with \"LP Ripper\". Several albums had very little silence between tracks, so this program couldn't identify the breaks. With no real explanation in the user manual about how to adjust, I had to figure it out for myself. The up and down arrows by the \"start\" and \"end\" radio buttons can be used to determine the length of the track. After some trial and error, I used the times of the songs from the album to figure this out. I've had this product for 2 weeks and have burned 17 albums so far. I have 70 more to go and a drawer full of cassettes. If you want to preserve your vinyl and you have a turntable, this is the way to go! I recommend it heartily."]}

Also, I walk around throughout my presentations and the remote has yet to let me down. Of course, proper placement of your receiving laptop is necessary.The Microsoft Wireless Presenter 3000 remote is a good size and fits nicely in my hand. I have had connectivity issues with it, however, as I have had to move closer to the receiver to get it to work. The last thing one wants during a presentation is to be distracted by technology. The mousing function is awkward and the back and forward buttons are small. The laser pointer is easy to access and utilize.The Logitech 2.4 GHz Cordless Presenter works well but does not have a mouse function. If any mousing needs to be part of your presentation, you are out of luck with this remote. Moreover, its quite expensive when compared to its competitors.I did not give the Keyspan remote 5 stars for the following two reasons: (1) It uses a coin cell battery (similar to a larger watch battery) so make sure to have one on you as it may be difficult to find on the road. (2) To turn the laser pointer on, it is somewhat awkward requiring the user to hold two buttons down at once. Once the laser is on, you can use it freely during the presentation but to activate it, you have to manipulate two buttons, for someone with large fingers, it may be annoying.Happy Pointing!"]}

If you try to cook a large box of long pasta in it it doesn't seem to cook right. Aside from all that - the fact that it can't handle repeated use with boiling water makes it a poorly tested, unsafe gimmick.Most of the As Seen On TV products that I have tried are garbage anyway.

My overall impression is: mixed.I have used these phones for about 6 months now, and while I don't know the actual history of these phones, I suspect they were designed by two separate groups: the base unit and then the handset unit. They show the classic problem of a marketing forced integration after the fact.Case in point, and why I guess some of the reviewers claim the phones synchronize with each other while others claim they don't. Both phones have a common memory size, but the architecture is different. Specifically, the word size in the handset units are different than the word sizes in the base unit. So you can record a phone message of say 32 characters in the desk unit (name plus number), while the word width in the handset is only 2/3 the size of the desk unit. Normal names/numbers are fine, but when you get into long names/numbers you get into the issue of where an entry which works with one unit will not fit into the other. A classic mechanism of how this can happen is where you have entered a long distance business number (11 digits) which gets you into a voice mail system, then you set up some pauses until the voice mail asks for the extension (typically 6-8 \"P\"s), then the extension (another 4 digits or so). The whole purpose of this is so that the auto dialer gets through the voice mail and goes directly to the person's extension. Works fine with the base unit but there are actually some numbers you can enter on the base which can't be entered in the handsets. I am an engineer, and this is very stupid for this kind of thing to happen.To compound this, it gets worse. While the base unit memory is wide, the handset's memory is long. The memory map is such that you can actually enter more names in the handset than you can in the base. So if you have a memory array which fills the handset and you try to synchronize to the base, the download will fill until the base if full and then give you a non-descriptive error message (communication's error).To me one of the greatest strengths of this product is the synchronization between base and handsets, and when this works it works well. It allows you to load addressees in one phone and then replicate them to all the other phones. Except when you get close to the limits of memory wherein the base is different that the handsets. And how close do you have to get to the end? My handset has a utilization of 56% (meaning 44% free), and I overflow the base unit. Big problem.I suspect that they have siphoned off directory memory for answering machine memory. The problem is that with a $400 product there is no excuse to not have added enough and separate memory in the first place.The handsets come with NiCd batteries. Again, with a $400 system I think this is cheap. No excuse not to have included NiMH.There are very subtle user interface issues which I think should have been resolved. If a number is busy, there is no way to automatically redial the number until completion. If you are on the phone and another call comes in, you answer the new call and transfer the new call to another phone, you actually transfer the new call and the old call (which remains on hold and to which there is no obvious way to retrieve it). A very nice feature (like my cellular phone) is a keyboard lockout so you don't accidentally press a button (you pulse the power button for this mode). But, this only works if there is no call going on. Try it during a conversation, and you turn the phone off. Make sure you have a UPS on the base station. If power goes off, you loose your answering messages and/or the phone locks up. To restart, you have to reset and redo all configuration options. Using FLASH ROM or a battery back-up would have prevented this (like most sub $100 phones these days), but not the $400 Siemens. There are many other issues like these which sound esoteric until all of a sudden they happen on you. In short, the user interface needs some work.On the positive side, there are many things the phone does very well. The sound is as close to a corded phone as I have seen in a portable. Many users have complained about distance, and I agree that the distance is no greater than the 900MHz phones. However it is also no worse. I get about 50 feet outside with the base unit inside. [Remember those 1500 feet Panasonic adds, forget it. Maybe if you add an external linear.]All in all, the handsets are very nice portable phones. However, the product in its current form is a nice first effort which ultimately remains flawed due to numerous inconsistencies and engineering aberrations. The product was good enough that I couldn't quite bring myself to return it, but frustrating enough that I cannot give it my wholehearted recommendation."]}

The pads in the mount are too soft so the laser moves around even when you do manage to get the screws tight. The adjustment is a joke and screws stripped out just trying to zero it for the first time. I haven't a clue why they included a coil cord pressure switch since you can't use it with the mounting and if you did want to use it there is no way to mount the laser. The rear cover threads are poorly cut so you need to be real careful screwing it together, its so easy to cross thread. The batteries go in backwards to make it work so be careful that you don't use any logic to load the batteries the first time. No instructions, so no guidance on its assembly, mounting, or use.

The waist seems a little too tight for me. I realize they're compression shorts, but the waist still seems too tight (not TOO uncomfortable, but still a bit worrisome).I actually have a similar pair to these that I bought like 8 years ago (that I still wear), and those were an XL too. I just figured they might've tweaked their sizes since then. But yea, I would definitely order a size (or two) BIGGER than what Under Armour says, if you're worried about the waist feeling too tight. Instead of returning my two pair for a new size (since I've already worn them for a workout), I might just try stretching them by leaving them on some sort of 36\" sphere for a day or so. Hopefully after a while, they'll actually stretch to fit a 33\" waist comfortably.Other than the sizing, these are great. Definitely a slick pair of well-compressed underwear. Nice colors for the waist band help too as they will surely show if you decide to go topless. I've always found the quality and materials to be superb for Under Armour products, and these are right on par with my expectations for that.

If you are a real coffee drinker & want your coffee in a hurry & need it to be at least a good mug size portion, this machine is NOT for you. You only have two choices for brewing, a small cup or large cup button to push. The small size is way to small of a portion & the large size only fills half of a mug size cup. So, the dilema is that you have to brew two portions in order to get a mug sized portion to drink. When one is in a hurry in the morning this is not a good thing to have to deal with and takes too much time plus negates the fact of saving on coffee grinds.The other problem was that the LCD display is not lighted so if you have this machine placed in a low light area you can forget about reading the display. Finally, you can't use your own coffee grinds to make coffee but have to use their portioned plastic K-cups.

While this phone basically does what it advertises to do, it fails to impress because of a certain amount of thoughtlessness in the details.For example, it is, in fact, imbued with a reliable caller ID service, speed dialing, and a helpful caller log. But the LED screen isn?t backlit. As a result all those neat features aren?t usable at night, when you perhaps need them most. Likewise, its small size at first seems a convenience?until you remember that comfort is more important in a home phone than portability. Bigger phones are better around the house, where you tend to want a phone you can actually rest on your shoulder.But its bigger offenses, I think, have to do with the way it performs its most basic functions: power and reception.It requires much more recharge time on the base than much older phones, and that charge evaporates quite quickly?even when the phone is not in active use. Worse, my particular unit?and maybe all of them--doesn?t reliably snap into the base. It?s possible to put the phone in the cradle and yet not have the contacts touch. As a result, the phone could spend hours in the cradle without recharging at all.Its reception, too, is baffling. While does have a fair range, it seems to pick up background noise more clearly than the sound of my voice--clearly the opposite of how you want a phone to work.I don?t mean to sound too negative, here. Most of the time it works like it?s supposed to. But I can?t help feeling if it had been tweaked with a little more market research, Seimens might have come up with a more practical product."]}

Nike Pro felt like paper and I could almost see thru it. The Under Armour was the sturdiest and thickest of the three. It also fitted well and I felt no stitching like I do with the Shock Doctor. The Shock Doc stitching is a little uncomfortable thought the fabric is strong.The only dislike is the availability of colours of the Under Armour through Amazon.

Where is the red or royal blue?My mother also bought the men's for herself as she wears it with no shorts over it like I do and found that the elastic waist could have been tighter on the Large Under Armour.

Problem solved. Doesn't leave any residue on the paper (and even if it did, it would be on the back of the paper - no biggie).

It's now 9/28/10 and I've used this Intex Pillow Rest Twin raised Airbed since 8/6/10.

I unplugged the pump and used a mattress pad/cover that I bought at Target (artificial down). The cover almost stretches down to the bottom of the mattress, but not entirely, and not enough to stay put. I just wanted something between the bed and my sheets/quilt. The odor was a bit strong, like a vinyl smell that stuck around for several days. Either the smell went away or I got used to it; I also washed the bedding a few times, more often, in the hopes that it would rub off on it.As for re-inflation, I noticed that the bed lost air very gradually over time, so I topped it off after about 5 weeks. I may have to update this if it looses air faster, upsetting the to-be-established curve. One would suppose that I had lucked out, but upon reflection, it occurred to me that if the bed were close enough to carpet tacking strips, it would be toast. Also, the head rest area doesn't do much for me, I could probably do without. I grant a 4 star review due to the fact that I have been able to actually sleep on it and it held the air longer than I ever thought it would.Update 8/5/12: This has been a great airbed to have. It's had much use these past two years and is still going strong. I kept it on carpeted surfaces, away from any carpet tacks, etc. Just needed the seldom re-inflation from time to time, and that still works too. Nice!"]}

Being a field biologist specializing in the study of animal behavior, I wanted a camera with high resolution (10 mp), good optical zoom (at least 10x), minimal delay between shutter release and recording on the CCD, fully manual focus option, video capacity, and reasonably light weight for carrying on my neck through the day. The Leica V-Lux 1 fits the bill as no heavy DSLR could possibly do. Similar \"advanced\" cameras by Canon, Fujifilm, and Nikon have less resolution or smaller zoom, or both, as well as other deficiencies. The Leica has proven to be a wonderful camera with which I have (in only a few months) taken an estimated 4000 photos -- but the price is a bit of a rip-off.Before explaining the rip-off, I report one annoying and initially alarming problem with the camera. In the field, in the low humidity environment of Patagonia (Chile), drizzle began and while the camera was under my rain jacket and did not get wet, the CCD went screwy. At first it put a purple haze over everything (viewfinder or LCD, viewing or playback, and permanent on the photo when downloaded). This aberration then turned to black and white horizontal lines. Nothing in the manual's troubleshooting section mentions this problem, although p. 5 deals with condensation fog, which I suppose this was an unusual version of. The camera was unusable for half a day, and then the patient spontaneously recovered from its strange malady.Returning to the rip-off, according to Wikipedia, all the Leica digital cameras (with two trivial exceptions) are actually made by Panasonic in Japan. The excellent lens systems appear to have been developed jointly by the two companies. Panasonic's Lumix DMC-FZ50 is nearly identical with the Leica V-Lux 1, with obvious differences in external finishes and labels, and hidden differences in the firmware, so that Leica processes white balance, noise reduction, etc. differently. If you don't want to pay for the Leica label, buy the Panasonic version at approximately half the price. (Yes, the pricing is really that different.)If you've already naively bought the Leica as I did -- or decide you want it despite the small difference from the Panasonic -- at least be aware that all the accessories are interchangeable (and again, the Panasonic versions run about half the price). Third party batteries and chargers are cheaper yet. Furthermore, Leica apparently does not post their manuals online for download, so go to Panasonic's website and get a pdf of the Lumix DMC-FZ50.Finally, I could not find that either Leica or Panasonic markets a teleconverter lens for the V-Lux/Lumix although such are mentioned on pp. 97-99 of \"the\" manual. (Yes, even the pagination is the same for the Leica and Panasonic manuals.) However, Olympus makes a 1.7x teleconverter with 55 mm diameter screw mount that fits the V-Lux/Lumix. That combines for a zoom of over 20x, and works just fine with my Leica.Panasonic DMC-FZ50 10.1MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)"]}

Mysteriously...or is it?I'm beginning to believe its absence has something to do with Cox Cable. They have been screwing around with the channel line up for the last few weeks, and then as soon as they settled it and stopped adding those critical new channels to their digital line-up (10 new shopping channels, non-mainstream religious channels, and 10 spanish-only language versions of existing stations, makes me wonder what the heck happened to SAP?) my TV GUIDE came back. Those of you whose Guide has stopped working, you might call your Cable Provider and see what they are up to. I'm very suspicious that they were blocking it while they were shuffling things around. Boneheads.Anyway, I still love the thing, although I have uncovered something new to watch out for. The box is VERY picky about what sort of DVD-R's it will record to, especially high speed record. I bought a batch of Maxell 8X DVD-R 4.7GB discs a few months ago and they worked great. Went back and bought what I thought were the same discs (turned out to be 16x's) and the box won't finalize them. Have had the same experience with other brands of disc too. Best luck so far are the Imation 8X's and the Verbatim 8X's, haven't had a single dud with either of those. God help me, I still think the box is the best thing since sliced bread!...mrb 9/6/2006***********************************************************I bought my 633H-s specifically for two reasons: 1) To turn an aging library of personal VHS and VHS-C camcorder tapes into a more durable media and 2)To automatically record movies, weekly sitcoms/drama, and sports without me having to think about it too much, in good quality, and giving me the option of burning whatever I wanted to DVD.It has performed #1 Perfectly. Essentially, I just need to find the best VCR I can, hook it up, and dump all the tapes to the hard drive (which I have done) and then mix and match them to DVD at my leisure. That worked flawlessly.#2 is where the 95% came in. Everybody seems to complain about the TV Guide being erratic, mine worked perfectly for about three months, but for the last couple of weeks, it has completely lost its mind. It's a real shame, because the thing is darned intelligent. I told it once to record an NBA playoff game, and then to find the others, and it recorded every NBA playoff game on every channel for the next two weeks without fail! It also is smart enough to look for programs regardless of time. I told it get me the SNL's, and it basically found them all. That's pretty cool.But, about two weeks ago, all my channel listings went blank! Here's the funny part....even though it can't find any programming, it still KNOWS programming. I typed into the search field \"Medium\" and it found the show! And I set it to record it, and it grabs every single one of them! I can't get the listings to show that it knows what \"Medium\" is, but apparently it still does. Weird!If you have HBO/CINEMAX/ENCORE/ etc movie channels, you cannot beat this box for over the cable record quality, even picks up a good semblance of my HD channels. And the coolest thing, any movie you grab on the hard drive that is about 2 hours 10 minutes or less, this thing will burn to DVD in 10-15 MINUTES!That to me, is the coolest feature yet.So, I'm still at 95%, puzzled and wondering if my Listings will ever return. If not, I may go for the \"peace\" of disabling the thing completely. But not yet, not as long as it remembers \"Medium!\".thx....Mike Bertaut"]}

The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get 12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says 12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes.

It almost succeeds in making CDs sound like well-recorded and well-pressed vinyl. It's a real delight to the ears. There is one caveat about how to hook it up (and I thank previous reviewers for alerting me to this). If you use it primarily for audio, be sure to use input 2.

I was in search of a glass cocktail shaker rather than a stainless and was pleasantly surprised finding this beautiful set. My personal experience is that the strainer on stainless shakers can be difficult to remove to rinse out between cocktails. Feigning a similarity to Anchor Hocking's Depression glass series entitled \"Manhattan,\" this set is quite nice. This glassware, also made by Anchor Hocking, is named \"Celebrate.\" My only annoyance with it is that the (9 oz. not 10 oz.) glasses are just too large for a single martini and a too many double martinis can be a problem. Oddly enough, the (18.5 oz.) shaker seems disproportionate to the glasses. However, with it's excellent horizontal rib styling I can easily overlook that. The shaker itself also has a rubber gasket at the top so that it prevents leaking, but can be a little difficult to take off the lid however, not as bad as a stainless model.

I laid out a footprint and I set up the tent by myself in my backyard. It only took me an hour. Time was not really the issue here. The size of this thing is. I took my time making sure I put it up correctly. It is big! I love it. I swear you can hear an echo inside without furniture. So I moved in. I put in a full sized airbed along with two cots for the two kids. I had plenty of room to spare. I could have easily put in my queen sized airbed with those two cots and still had room for a lot of gear. I am 6'1\" tall and had plenty of room to spare before reaching the summit of this tent.I spent the next 2 nights in this condo with driving rain and wind keeping me awake. The wind was about 20-to 30 mph gusts. The poles are so sturdy the tent shook all night but there was no chance this tent was going anywhere. It continued to rain 4 inches here in Atlanta over three days. There was a little leakage however. The fly leaked a little and the zipper at its stop. I had put a footprint under the tent that was larger than the tent (big mistake). This caused a lake affect under the tent. It felt like I was on a water bed. I didn't realize this until I stepped on the floor the next morning. I used my arm as a squeegee and it just filled up again. BUT there was NO leakage on the bathtub type floor. Those seams are sealed tighter than my uncle's wallet.When it quit raining I sealed the fly and the zipper stop. Then it snowed heavy huge snowflakes. Imagine that. Atlanta got 6 inches of snow. The fly drooped with the weight of the wet snow but the inside stayed dry. I just wacked the edges of the fly and created an avalanche effect around the tent. It did not seep into the tent.The next week I took it camping for 3 days and it was nice and dry. Set up was a little easier this time but it became dark upon arrival and a couple of nice folks helped me set it up. It took us about 15 minutes. I recommend that two folks work together to set up this big honking tent. Also make sure your footprint is smaller than your tent and seal the fly. I purchased a smaller tent and will use the Bitterroot as a base-camp as I participate in Bigfoot expeditions. With the tent being as cavernous as it is I feel like I need to bring more stuff than I should. Therefore it takes longer to pack up than it should because of all that EXTRA stuff I bring. The tent is a snap to disassemble and pack up. 15-20 minutes when doing it solo.What a nice big tent! And it is very nice looking too.

I bought my VTech phone (and an extra handset) almost exactly a year ago. Since then I've gotten to know the phone inside-and-out and discovered just how &quot;durable&quot; it really is.Pros: - The phone size is excellent. The smaller the better and this is by far the lightest, smallest phone out there. I can fit it in my pocket easily. If you dislike small phones then this might be a con for you.- Handsfree dialing. I can dial my 7 digits and then hit talk. It's a silly feature, but I love it. Can't explain why. I can also hit the speakerphone button instead of talk and it goes right into speakerphone mode.- Great speakerphone mode. Very clear. I can set it on my desk and talk to someone at a comfortable distance and they can't tell I'm on speakerphone unless my AC is running.- Good range. I didn't measure the distance, but I live in an apartment complex and can go downstairs, around the building, past the next building, and to the pool before it gets fuzzy. It also chirps when it loses contact, which is nice to know.- Good features like the headset jack, speakerphone, and multiple-base support.Cons:- After a year, one of the phone's batteries is completely toast. They're not cheap either.- After 6 months of usage, the headset jack now makes static whenever you move even the slightest bit.- Caller ID works but could be a LOT more intelligent. You can't easily store numbers from Caller ID into your phonebook.- Volume is a pain to adjust. No easy up/down buttons, it's in the menuing system... which is slow and cumbersome.- If you answer the phone while it's gathering the Caller ID data (during the first ring) the phone will crash and you'll lose your call. This is VERY annoying.- I don't know why, but I never used the phonebook function to store numbers. I think I found it too cumbersome like the rest of the menu system.So.. if you don't mind the occasional crash or replacing your batteries yearly, then this isn't a bad phone. However, I have to hope that there's something better out there with a better interface, more reliable components, with the same feature set and small size.If only Nokia would make a cordless."]}

First let me say that I purchased my machine at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I bought it due to the range of brew sizes offered, specifically the 11 oz travel brew size, and the variety of coffees and teas offered. I loved the fact that I could have a hot cocoa or some tea and then my hubby could have his AA Kenya one second later. My husband and I used the machine daily at least 2 times a day for a month. Per Keurig recommendations, we never shut it off or used the auto shutdown or auto on features. We only used bottled or filtered water. Almost exactly a month to the day I purchased it, it began it shut off after brewing. It would give me my cup then sort of sit there and hum for a minute then shut off. This happened after every K cup. Not what I was expecting for $160.From the other reviews I have read both here and on the Keurig site, the problem seems to be the water intake function from the outer water tank to the inner tank and the shut offs are the beginning of the death spiral for this machine. I have already called Keurig for an exchange because taking it back to BB&B; will probably just get me a machine from the same bad batch. The CSR from Keurig said I won't be able to get a new machine til May, so now I am stuck with a bunch of K cups I can't use. If I had to do it again, I would not have purchased this machine. The reviews were already out there, and I should have listened. This is too much money to spend for something that died after a month. Hopefully, Keurig has fixed the problem because as of now you can't even order this machine directly from them. Will post an update once I get it.***Update***I got the new machine a few days after this review, which was much faster than quoted. There was a noticable difference with the water intake area. With the new machine, there is a much stronger sound when it pulls the water in. I have not had any issues so far. We still use it 2 to 3 times a day and use filtered water. Hopefully it lasts, so I am adding a star."]}

Be aware that this model does NOT have an answering machine, though Uniden does make a similar model WITH an answering device built-in. That omission somehow escaped me when reviewing the long list of features, and I ordered thinking it did. The features it does have are excellent, and it programs and operates fairly intuitively. The base and wireless handsets are extremely flexible in the way the system can be set up. The phones are exceptionally compact, not much larger than the size of many current one-piece cell phones. If a user's vision is impaired, they'll have a difficult time seeing the labels on, beside, and under the keys, however. The handsets fit nicely in the hand and are comfortable on the ear. Conversation is very sharp and clear. The display is large and handsome with the backlighted orange, which turns on automatically when making a call or receiving an incoming call, together with a red blinking light on each handset. My single disappointment is with the range, which is not much better than our former Siemens models. We use these in a 5,500 sq. ft. well-built home, which stretches the limits of any wireless phone system designed and priced for home use. Of the attractions of both systems for me was that neither the Siemens nor the Uniden has an ugly protruding antenna on its handsets. However, with the Uniden, you must be careful not to hold your hand over the back of the upper part of the handset if you've more than about 25' from the base or some some signal interference results. There are many things to like about this system, and the only thing I regret is not ordering the model with the built-in answering machine."]}

We have a 6 year old digital answering machine from Panasonic that sounds better than the one on this unit. We have a $20 speaker phone that sounds better than the one on this unit. The speaker phone on either the handset or the base unit are useless - your mouth has to be so close to the microphone for you to be heard that you need to be holding it anyway - though you can hear just fine with it. But if you have to be within a foot of the thing you might as well be holding it.We had to replace the first one of these we got. There were a multitude of problems that didn't show up until the second day we had it plugged in... couldn't dial out, couldn't be heard using either base or handset, couldn't use the speakerphone on the base, etc. We phoned Panasonic to ask for some help and they told us they'd send us a refurbished one or we could send this one in for repairs. We told them that we didn't want a refurbished one, we paid for a new one and expect to get one that works and they said, \"sorry, talk to the vendor.\" Which we did. Amazon immediately replaced it, no questions asked (they even sent the replacement 2nd day air). The replacement definitely works better, but also it was clear it had been taken out of the box - not sure if it's a refurbished or just a recycled return.On the plus side, the handset seems clear enough when you hold it to your head. We weren't worried about the complaints about the battery not lasting long because we tend to leave our phones on the charger anyway. Overall though, we're pretty disheartened with Panasonic (there's a group of engineers who should be hanging their heads in shame after putting out this flakey product)... and not at all happy with the state of \"expandable phone systems\" in general."]}

This player has come down in price almost 50% since I bought it 1 year ago. It has superb picture quality and sound quality when playing either CDs or DVDs. The features are unmatched in this price range and all work really well. Occasionally (not on all DVDs) I have noticed it hesitate in the middle of moving from one chapter to the next but I have also seen this problem on most DVD players my friends have - some of those players are a lot more expensive than this one too. Navigation is easy either with the remote or the on-unit controls. Both give you quick access to the features you want. It will auto-power off if you leave the tray open and always shuts the tray when it turns off. The drive inside this thing is ultra-quiet. The remote is probably one of the easiest to use - I'm almost sad to be replacing it and the other 4 I have with a universal learning remote. I really bought this unit for its assortment of compatibility with DVD/VCD/CD, MP3, CD-R, DVD-R, and CD-RW as well as the impressive stats for the 54MHz video DAC, 192kHz/24-bit audio converter, optical and coaxial digital audio outputs with Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel pass-through, component-video, composite-video, and S-Video terminals. All of which live up to their claims. Unfortunately, Macrovision protection prevented me from copying DVDs to video tape for playing on my kids TV/VCR combo - oh well.So the only real disappointment is the MP3 playback. The manual comes with a detailed explanation of the limitations of the MP3 playback. MP3 CDs must be 650MB, use DOS-style 8.3 names and files cannot be listed in sub-directories. It also does not extract ID3 tags so you are limited to the file name for determining what MP3 is being selected. You can also only have up to 254 MP3 files on any CD you put in the Toshiba 3750. I was successfully able to compile an MP3 CD that met all of these criteria including the 128-kbit 44.1kHz sample rate and the MP3 playback was horrible. Pops and crackles and a very dull tone made the MP3 feature useless to me. So, instead I have a Creative Nomad now. Still highly recommended for DVDs - hopefully my next DVD/MP3 CD player will be better."]}

When the signal is off, there is no sound from the speakers (one reviewer mentioned a 'buzz', but I hear nothing but silence!). When a signal is present, the amp powers on within a second or two. The delay prior to auto off is adequate as I've not had any music inadvertently cut off, and I listen to a wide range of music genres plus talk radio. And, while I am only using the A speaker connections now, having another set of connections for a second set of speakers is a nice future option. Overall I am very pleased with this unit.

Of course, some people would actually consider that to be an advantage, but I don't. 3) The buttons tend to wobble rather than go down smoothly on pressing; you will learn to press with the flat side of your fingers rather than with the fingertips (ladies, please note!) (if you have stubby fingers - no problemo!). 4) The base does not have a battery backup, so in case of power failure, this phone won't work. Make sure you have a phone in your home or office that you can use in a power outage. (Of course, if you are rich enough to have your own power source - no problemo!!)"]}

I was on a budget and this amp really fit the bill. I purchased 2 of them (refurbished from J&R; Electronics through amazon) and tested both last night. I am happy to say that both worked flawlessly.A few things:As others have mentioned, you need to use input 2 for the amp to stay on without cutting out.This amp is meant to be able to use A, B, or *BOTH* A+B at the same time. Meaning that I can either listen only in my living room (A) or my kitchen (B) or both my living room and kitchen at the same time (A+B). If you're amp does not work this way, there is something wrong with the one you received.Garbage in, garbage out. If you are expecting fantastic sound from an ipod that has low quality mp3's on it... you *will be* disapointed. I noticed significant degredation in sound quality once i got the speakers in my house on a real amp. Once I got my UDAC setup and was able to play all the lossless quality audio i have stored on my PC (mostly WMA files) the sound is fantastic and an extreme improvement overall.My setup is as follows:PC to Nuforce UDAC (purchased here on amazon) to my receiver Yamaha rx-v2700 (older receiver does not pass digital signals to 2nd/3rd zones). My PC is upstairs, reciever is downstairs so I used a USB to ethernet adapter to run through the walls (75 ft of Cat6a) and locate the Nuforce UDAC closer to my receiver. Zone 2 on the receiver out to one of the audiosource 100 amps, zone 3 on the receiver out to the 2nd audiosource 100 amp. Then from the amps out to the speakers throughout the house (Garage/Back deck on one amp, and Living Room/Kitchen on 2nd amp)."]}

The Riedel glasses are clearly superior. The Libbey ones are OK, but the Riedel glasses, in my opinion, are worth paying more for. Because of how thin they are, I'm careful with them -- I've only hand washed them at this point, and am deliberately gentle when I set them down. It's possible I don't need to be so cautious, but I'd like to keep them around for a long time! If you have young children in your household, the Libbey glasses seem sturdier (but is also why they are not as enjoyable to drink out of).The Riedel glasses are so thin, you *almost* feel like you could cut yourself on them. (Not that they are sharp or painful in any way; just describing the thinness!)I also boughtRiedel H2O Whiskey/Double-Old Fashioned Glass, Set of 2, which are essentially the exact same shape as these, but I prefer the whiskey glasses because they're about twice as tall. These smaller ones need to be refilled more often.The reason I'm giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the level of condensation that forms with ice-cold drinks. It seems to be far more than normal. Coasters are a MUST with these glasses if you like to put ice in your drinks. And even with a coaster, a big enough pool of liquid forms at the bottom that I actually need to sop it up with a towel, or it threatens to drip off the coaster and onto the table. Still, if that's the price I have to pay for such a great glass to drink out of, I pay it gladly."]}

This powerful non-graphing calculator has over 300 functions, a two line display, and you pretty much enter algebraic expressions as they're written (just be careful to use parenthesis and order of operations). An overlooked feature is its dual power mode. If there's enough room light it runs off solar power, preserving batteries. No worries of the juice going during your final. (I'll take this feature this over extraneous, additional, functions of that new Sharp calculator.) This calc has MORE than enough in terms of functions, power, and various equasion, complex number, and statistical modes. In terms of pure number crunching power, this calculator blows everything else away in its price range, except perhaps the latest Sharp. A co-worker who has a Master's in math took a look at this and told me it's all the calculator you need, all the way up through graduate school.Just note that this is NOT a symbolic algebra calculator - that is, it will attempt to solve for (multiple) variables, as in X=2.453. However it won't expand, group, or simplify algebraic expressions. Don't expect to enter (a+b)^2 and get a^2+2AB+b^2 back, or vice versa. For that, you'll need the much pricier TI-89 or TI-92 Plus, which has a symbolic algebra mode.However, if you want the most bang for your buck, go with this over the lower-end TI's (imo) and others. Much more power for the same money, and this is very nicely designed.Documentation is spartan but it'll get you there. Just have a magnifying glass handy or download the PDF file from Casio's site. The upside of having a small fold-out user guide is that you can always have it near your calculator. I keep mine rubberbanded to the calculator's case, so it goes where my calculator goes. (Having a 260 page book would negate the calculator's portability, wouldn't it?)Some nice math instructor of few reviews down put together a great supplemental document for this calculator with some good examples. Highly recommended if you buy this calculator (and thank you).Excellent product. Subtract a point for not having a more detailed downloadable user's guide with more examples on Casio's website. I can see not wanting to drive up the price by including a paperback book, but c'mon, Casio. It's 2006! We have the Internets and pdfs now!"]}

It wasn't too difficult to figure out that this phone's base is sensitive to RF noise (I can't tell if it was from the electrical outlet or the phone line). I moved the base from the kitchen to the bedroom (based on an earlier review about noise when the microwave was on), and the sound quality is much better. If moving it to another room isn't an option, buy an RF filter at any electronics store. After that, it's a wonderful phone to have, both in terms of sound quality and features. Also, since the batteries are NiMh, and not NiCad, you can put the phone in the charger whenever you want to without worrying about memory effect. And in my humble opinion, an extremely lightweight phone (because it has an extremely lightweight battery) with a charge life of only 2 days is fine, as long as I can put it in the charger it nightly without worrying about memory effect.

I only use the concentrator attachment for the last few minutes of styling, and noticed that it also started bubbling and quickly burnt big holes on either side of the attachment. The dryer doesn't get as hot as a lot of them out there, so I'm kinda baffled by this. It's actually the first time I've ever seen it happen on any dryer I've ever used. Long story short, I expected the dryer to last longer than just under two months.

Overall this machine does the job and seems reasonably priced. I have no problems with scanning and copying. When it comes to printing though, I think there have got to be better options available out there. I agree fully with those who've said they were frustrated with the poor paper handling. From my experience, I'd say this machine mishandles paper about 2-5% of the time. I like to print documents on both sides however, and the rate seems to go up considerably when you reload printed paper in this fashion. This is not to mention the compounded error involved when you load a stack of copies to print the back and all pages are thrown off after the beast sucks up 2-3 sheets instead of one. You won't likely save any trees or money on paper with this machine. Another complaint I have is that the driver software is huge, with even the express install at about 300 MB, and the imaging programs are really nothing special. The print cartridges (HP95/98) are too small and too expensive...I generally have to replace the black and white after about 250 pages of plain text typing. The LCD screen looks impressive, however it is nothing more than a useless decoration in my opinion. I've owned a few HP printers in the past, and I've stuck with them because they've been durable and done a decent job. The performance of this model is not much worse than those I've used before, but its shortcomings are pretty annoying.

Dollar-for-dollar, CASIO makes the most affordable and powerful calculators (for the price). I could not locate the Casio FX 2.0 in any of my local major retailers (Casio, are you stupid?) which I needed for electrical engineering class... and so I had to settle for the CFX980-GBPlus. From the start, I was a tad dissapointed, although for the most part.... there were few things which I could not do... my primary beef was just the dumb way in which you had to perform some operations which were very laborious or cumbersome... but thats true with TI's and even worse with the top end HP's. For instance, I need to readily convert alot of HEX/BINARY/DECIMAL numbers for a microprocessor and ASM class; and I found this to be a very tedious and slow operation. The manual is very big and fairly thorough, yet there were vital and basic precalc math functions which were not even in the manual. If you are planning to use this calculator for calculus, my advice would be to forget it.... Calculus IS NOT the strong suite of this unit.. It does certain things like complex sigma notation fairly well... but you encounter way too many errors when you start getting into integrals. Using a standard calculus book as a test reference, I plugged in about 60 different definate and indefinate integrals and I got an error rate of 70 percent... I'm not doing it wrong... it's just the calculator sucks for calculus. It'll work for basic calculus; if your really desperate.... but if your buying this specifically for Calculus class.... just buy one of the cheaper TI models. The one thing I like about CASIO is the keyboard layout is better on average, than either TI or HP... nothing pisses me off more than having to go into a complex menu series just to perform a very basic trig operation.. Personally, I think Casio should put a base-n conversion and a polar-to-rectangular converter on the keyboard because those are pretty basic functions which people may need access to readily. They should also put a hotkey for calculus on the keyboard... so I dont have to go into the menu to get to calculus.. although it's still pretty easy understanding the very simple menu structure. All in all.........money well spent. I'm happy... but this is no substitute for a TI-89/92 or a HP48/49. I'm probably not even going to bother getting the Casio FX2.0... because I suspect it's not going to be good for calculus.. As for all the high school or college students who say that you should get a TI just because it is &quot;standard&quot;... while that is wise in some respects, it's also foolish. Teachers can help most if you have a TI calculator, because thats standard in most U.S. schools... but ultimately, it's the students responsibility to learn how to use the calculator... it really only takes a few days of playing around with the calculator to learn how to do most of the functions... so there should not be any need whatsoever for you students to be asking your teacher how to use the calculator... it's not calculator class... it's math class. They teach the math... YOU learn your own calculator."]}

I didn't use the product there but assume it made it's way there due to gravity. So if you are over 55 and find any irritation , I say ,toss it. The regular non AHA nutrogena is better for moisturizing."]}

My wife actually bought our Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System. I had no desire for the machine as I don't drink coffee that often and even when I do, I only drink decaf due to my heart condition. My wife was nice enough to buy me a sampler collection of decaf coffee to try with this Keurig B70 machine. Let me start with the good news. It does make a decent cup of coffee. It's also capable of making tea, iced tea, cappuccino and hot cocoa. Cleanup is fairly quick and easy, and the coffee can be made in less then a minute after the machine has warmed up. Because this is an individualized coffee machine, you can select from a huge assortment of coffee products including Green Mountain, Paul Newman, Timothy's, Gloria Jean's, Donut House, Emeril's L. coffee, Starbucks and lots more. There's a lot to choose from which is nice. If you're a coffee lover this is great product to look into.Now for the bad new and there's a lot from what I've read on here. First of all many of the coffees provided seem weak compared to their regular brewing methods. I've tried making them with full cups and even regular size cups and many of them aren't as strong as if you made them yourself with your normal measurements. The Hot Chocolate is very weak as well and is not as chocolaty as it should be. A packet of Swiss Miss or Nestle is actually better. I wasn't happy with the cocoa. I haven't tried the hot tea. The ice tea wasn't bad. You do have to add your own sugar. It was a lot better then the hot cocoa.As for the machine itself, it's not as user friendly as it should be. For one it appears many, many people have had a multitude of problems. From leakage, to water not coming out into the filters. Problems with the machine not turning on or only brewing 2oz of coffee. My issue was with the settings. It takes almost 4 minutes for the machine to warm up. After that, hitting BREW did nothing. I literally had to reopen the door and close it a 2nd time for the \"BREW\" to actually start working. I had set the cup size to the 4th size and it was reset to full size after I opened the door. I wasn't aware of that until after I hit BREW and couldn't stop it. Unacceptable. Something this simple shouldn't be this flawed. Now I have to wait 6-12 months to see what else starts breaking on this thing. I'm glad I wasn't the one who shelled out the $150 for it.Is the machine worth the price? I don't think so. I think it's worth maybe 1/2 of what they are currently charging for it. No more then $70-$80. The reason being is it breaks way to often and the reason the makers can offer you $100 discounts is because they know it's only costing them $50-$60 to make the damn thing. They also know that you'll still have to buy their coffee to use it. So they will still make money, no matter what. It's a win-win for Kuerig makers, but the customer is really the loser if they shell out more money for a new machine. If they replace the machine for FREE, then that's fine, but we know they won't do that often.UPDATE (6/23/2012)Wow, it didn't even take 6 months for something to break on this thing. The new issue we are having with the Keurig Coffee Maker is a sensor light called \"PRIME\". This appears when there is something wrong with the water container attached to the machine. It tells you to pour the water out and clean the connections and other pieces that connect from the water container to the machine. My wife did this and reattached it. Two cups of coffee later the \"PRIME\" error appeared again. My son cleaned it and it worked for one more cup of coffee and the error appeared again. I suggested just unplugging it and plugging it back it. Yo and behold, it worked. At least for another cup of coffee. Sigh.... It appears that whoever programmed the sensor into this thing made a grave error. The PRIME sensor is coming on even though there really isn't any issue with the container. Unplugging the machine seems to reset the sensor. The creators of the Keurig really need to go back and change the parts on it to quality material. It's obviously that this was cheaply made with cheap parts to save money and reap large profits. I'm pretty sure it's only costing $45-$50 to make these. That would explain why customers are having so many issues with them. Stay clear of Keurig. I don't think it's worth your money or time.UPDATE (8/28/2012)Just a quick update. The \"PRIME\" issue seems to have resolved itself. After leaving it off and turning it back on ONLY for use for about 3 weeks, the \"PRIME\" error no longer comes on. We have had it permanently \"ON\" now for just over a month and have not seen the \"PRIME\" error again since. I have no idea what fixed the issue. My wife has coffee every morning and has had no further issues with the system. I'll give it until the end of the year and come back with one last update if something bad happens."]}

I bought one of these to put in my classical guitar case. My nephew just bought an $1800 Martin guitar and he also bought one. We each have different brands of hygrometers but they both read RH of 39% to 41% inside the cases. My house has 2 small room humidifiers going all the time in the winter which keeps the air somewhere around 30%. His apartment is dry as a bone with no humidification at all.He probably gets down to 20% when it's really cold out and he has the heat cranked up. Yet the humidity in our guitar cases is the same.The reviewer who said they don't absorb water at all is wrong. I weighed the Herco on an electronic gram scale when I bought it. Dry, it weighed around 75 grams. After soaking it for 5 minutes in a bowl of water, it weighed 80-85 grams. Then I zeroed out an empty bowl and started adding drops of water. It turns out the Herco absorbs about a teaspoon or two of water. Not much, but all you need to keep the guitar in a safe range. After all, all those people that advocate putting a sponge in a plastic container with holes drilled into it always tell you to wring it out. After you wring it out, how much water do you think is left. I'd guess around a teaspoon. It just doesn't take that much to humidify such a small space. The humidifier that came with my humidor for tobacco measures about 3x8x6 inches. The humidity goes to 68%.That humidifier also only holds a teaspoon or so.Bottom line, it's dangerous to put a humidifier inside the guitar. Much better to use a Herco. I resoak mine about every 2 weeks. When I first got it I'd check the weight of it, knowing that if it went back to 75 grams, it was dry. After checking that a few times I came up with the 2 week time span.The absolute perfect humidity for a wooden musical instrument is somewhere between 40 to 50%. The Herco keeps it in the lower range of that here in wintry New England."]}

I had a twin size Aerobed mattress for several years and I was very happy with it. When it finally developed a leak, I went shopping for a replacement. I decided to try Intex rather than Aerobed because it is 5\" longer and I read complaints about recent models of Aerobeds having leaks. As usual, I read all of the Amazon reviews on this bed and I noted the complaints about leaks, but it seemed like a large majority of people were happy with it. I decided to give it a try since Amazon has a good return policy.When I got the bed, I had it inflated within 5 minutes of removing it from the box. The inflation process is very quick and easy and I found the bed to be comfortable. Unfortunately, when I came back an hour later, the bed was noticeably soft. It hit the inflation button and quickly the bed became firm again, but again, and hour later the bed was too soft to sleep on.Amazon is sending a replacement and I will update this review. If the second bed leaks, I will not try the Intex brand any more.Update: I received the replacement bed from Amazon within 3 days, great service! Fortunately, the replacement bed does not leak. It has been inflated for 3 days with no discernible loss of air. I should add that both beds have a strong chemical smell, but I assume this will dissipate in a couple of weeks. I am ultimately satisfied with my purchase, but I am leaving the rating low because it is a hassle to return the first bed and the manufacturer should have better quality controls.Update 2: The bed worked well for a little over a year, but now has developed a leak which requires air to be added every couple of hours. I am shopping for a replacement, but I do not think I will try an Intex product again."]}

This game had so much potential but from the very beginning it proved itself to be awkward and a terrible baseball game. The hitting engine is pathetic and it's nearly impossible to see the pitches right. Every player has huge legs and a funny pasted on face that slightly resembles reality. The graphics are OK but older versions of MVP trump them...actually MVP 2005 kicks this game into the gutter. The fielding dynamics are frustrating as well, and there is very little control over throwing and jumping/diving. Then there's the management part of the game, trading sucks, and the whole roster management is fragmented to a maddening degree. My advice, wish this game had never been made and wait till MLB 2k6 or give up until EA can make MLB licensed games again."]}

The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before. Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today. One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole: the pinstripe on the sole of high quality shoes is thick and solid. While the pinstripe on the Converses of today are thin and weak (and they rip and tear off from my experiences; something that NEVER happened with the quality of before) That's just one indicator. There are many subtle differences that combined make a huge difference in overall quality and durability. The quality went down since Nike bought Converse some time ago (and yet the prices went up). But the style is classic and if you like to wear new-looking Converse, then the Converse of today will do for you. But if you're like me and prefer sporting your kicks dirty and beat-up and for an extended period of time, I suggest you go on Ebay and buy a pair of Converse kicks from before.

I have two computers, one on a desk that already had a sliding keyboard tray and the other a flat table like thing which I installed this on. I do feel I type better with the sliding tray, it makes my posture straighter, and it feels easier on my eyes because I'm a farther distance away from the screen. However, comparing this Keyboard tray to my sliding desk, the sliding desk wins hands down. The Fellowes product is sturdy, but it's small and does at times feel weak and cramped. Imagining an office setting, I don't think it would be unbearable to continue working with the keyboard on a level desk, or simply easier to upgrade the entire desk to one with a sliding keyboard tray.Overall, I think you know whether or not you need a product like this. The truth is, it does work as advertized, but be warned that while it saves space and helps with posture, it's not perfect and a little wobbly and cramped.

The day after writing a review of my Microsoft Optical Intellimouse, against which I questioned if the Kensington Optical Pro would steal back my Kensington loyalty, I found the Kensington mouse locally at half-price. Because of the low price, I went ahead and bought it in spite of uncertainties regarding the Windows 2000 drivers.In short, if you use Windows 2000, I do not recommend this mouse. Kensington is still developing their drivers and only have a beta release available for Win2K, identified as version 5.60b8 (as of 1/18/01). On my system I found the mouse might initially work just fine but would lose functionality of the keys after a short period of time. Although my system multi-boots between Win2K and Windows Millennium, I didn't try the mouse out under the latter, since Win2K is more frequently used.So, for now I have relegated the mouse to use on my Windows NT4 PC at work, where it does perform just fine and with the full dynamic reprogramming of the mouse buttons as I switch between applications. I did have problems initially with scrolling in Internet Explorer 5.5 but that was resolved by selecting &quot;Office 97 Style&quot; scrolling in the MouseWorks control panel. Given that the mouse works properly with WinNT4, I'm pretty confident that it would work well also in Windows Millennium, since those drivers are likely quite similar to the Windows 9x drivers that, like WinNT4, have been around long enough to have matured. That is, Windows 2000 was quite a large change and thus I guess one could expect drivers for it to be more unique than those for the other operating systems. Regardless, it is quite annoying that Kensington doesn't have out fully working drivers for Windows 2000 as the O/S is now about 1 year old.Ergonomically, my opinions are mixed in comparison to the Microsoft Optical Intellimouse. On both mice, I'd rather see the side buttons moved forward just a bit more, and that is more true of the Kensington mouse which requires more effort to depress the buttons. The top mouse buttons on both mice have a comfortable activation effort, but I'd give a nod to the Kensington as being closer to my personal preferences. And, as expected, I do much more prefer the tension on the wheel of the Kensington. This is more noticeable as I switch between the mice at home and at work. The MS mouse wheel can literally be spun with a flick of the finger while the Kensington cannot; I prefer the added feel of the latter. As for the mouse body, the Kensington loses out to the MS mouse in two aspects: A slicker surface finish that wouldn't be so bad if not also for the body tapering toward the bottom. With the slick finish, the result is the mouse requires a firmer grasps as you pull it back towards you. While the taper may fit the lower part of one's palm better, adding some outward contour to the mouse sides would've improved things. With exception of the Kensington Thinking Mouse which I really liked the comfort of, I've long thought Microsoft holds the reign on overall comfort in the shapes they use in their Intellimouse series. Of course, this is probably a very personal choice, where others may favor the very sculpted Logitech designs.I'm giving this mouse 4 stars since I suspect a greater majority of PC users will be running Win9X/Me/NT4 systems than Windows 2000. Although there are some ergonomic shortcomings, the overall MouseWorks functionality remains a very strong selling point in my mind. For Windows 2000 users, I recommend the MS Optical Intellimouse until Kensington delivers fully working drivers; at that point, you'll have to let your own ergonomic preferences dictate the final choice."]}

UPDATE 01.28.12:Can't even give this piece of junk away, everyone I offer it to says \"Yeah, no thanks, a friend of mine has one and HATES it.\"This thing is garbage, and that's where it ended up. Thanks Keurig for adding your huge pile of junk \"coffee\" maker to our local landfill, at my expense.UPDATE 06.21.11:I wish I could give negative stars, this item doesn't even deserve A star. Even my wife finally gave up and admitted that a regular coffee pot is both easier and faster to use and of course actually makes good coffee. This awful Keurig POS doesn't make \"coffee\" at all, it makes coffee-flavored water that's barely drinkable.DO NOT waste your money on this hunk of cr@p, once again... expensive, wasteful, inconvenient and it makes utterly awful coffee. Ours is GONE, and I regret having wasted the time to own it.UPDATE 03.02.11:I officially hate this item. If zero stars were an option this would get it. If you use the K-cups it's convenient but the coffee is watery cr@p and you'll generate tons of garbage even if you only drink moderate amounts of coffee. You can run the brewer twice, but really? For $300 I have to run it twice just to get a decent cup of coffee? And compared to regular coffee the K-cups are expensive.If you want to use regular coffee you can use the My K-Cup insert but it's completely inconvenient and wastes tons of water to clean the stupid filter holder thingy.Basically... if you want to drop $300 for expensive, watery coffee... or if you just want a nice hassle every morning to clean a fiddly little insert over and over... this is your brewer.But if you just want decent coffee quickly with virtually no waste, no mess and no hassle... spend $20 on a one-cup brewer. Even if it breaks once a year you can buy a new one every year for 15 years before you reach the cost of this POS Keurig, and the amount of garbage generated will be significantly less too.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Bought this item for my wife. All the reviews saying that it makes incredibly weak coffee are 100% accurate, but that's not the only issue. There are many basic failures with this device, none of them individually bad enough to warrant a 1 star rating but when gathered together... pretty close. Here's my issues....1. This is just a mind-boggling oversight on something like this IMO... there's 5 sizes you can brew, from tea cup to travel mug... but the brewer doesn't in *any* way change what it does based on the size of cup you choose... so if you brew tea-cup size you get a bitter overly-strong cup. If you brew travel mug size you get brownish coffee-flavored water. So instead of getting a consistent, evenly strong cup of coffee across all 5 cup sizes the flavor and strength of the coffee varies wildly between cup sizes.2. At normal cup size the coffee, even when using \"dark roast\" k-cups, is anemic and tasteless.3. Wasteful on several levels, starting with the fact that if you brew using a k-cup the coffee is weak, if you brew again with the same k-cup in the machine... there's PLENTY of coffee left in there... so if you toss a K-cup away after one use you just wasted 50% of the coffee you paid for.4. Also using the K-Cups generates huge amounts of garbage. If you have a family of two coffee drinkers who drink a cup twice a day you generate 4 pieces of garbage per day just from this device. Doesn't sound like much, but multiply that by 7 days a week and by lord knows how many families... that's a lot of garbage.5. The available \"My k-cup\" filter that allows you to use your own ground coffee is tremendously wasteful of water and also brews a very weak cup. It's a major PITA to clean and you'll use more water just getting it cleaned up for the next use than you'll use in two or three cups of coffee. Massively inconvenient and not water-conscious at all. Mind you I'm not tree hugger, so when a device makes me aware of how much garbage it generates and how much water it wastes... there's a problem.6. Splashes coffee out of cups as it brews.So basically... choose your poison: Expensive, wasteful K-cups... or inexpensive but majorly inconvenient My k-cup filter that wastes tons of water to clean and is a major hassle to clean. Neither choice is what I would call ideal.The only reason I haven't returned this item is that we did figure out how to get a decent cuppa out of it... brew twice per k-cup. Once on the tea-cup size, then open the lid and close it and brew again (into the same coffee cup) on the next size up, using the same k-cup. Coffee then is a good strength and it is fast enough that brewing twice is not a big deal.But seriously... should I have to figure out a \"workaround\" to get a $300+ coffee maker to make a decent cup of coffee? I don't think so. And even having a decent cup in my hand doesn't alleviate the other problems. I won't return it, but I certainly would NOT suggest anyone buy this."]}

It might be less noticeable when used for main or surround speakers, but it sounded horrible on a subwoofer and made the amp seem cheap.Besides the issues I mentioned, it worked fine and the sound quality was adequate (when it would stay on long enough to hear it).I ended up disconnecting it because it wasn't working out and decided to use an older stereo receiver that can be turned on/off with my Harmony remote."]}

My intent was that I would spend significantly more money but get a shredder with high performance and high durability.My expectations were met on the high performance end. This shredder would handle 5-6 sheets of paper at a time without problem and would chomp right through staples without a pause. The motor definitely had more torque than other home models I have used and the automatic eye and reversing feature worked just as expected. My only negative was that I hadn't sprung for the extra bucks and gotten the confetti cut version.I have pretty typical home usage patterns -- probably 5-10 pages 1-2 times a week. Significantly less that the rating on this machine. But recently the shredder started accummalating paper between the shredder wheels until it wouldn't function correctly anymore. When I disassembled the shredder head to remove the paper build-up, I noticed that the true cause of the failure was several plastic fingers that had broken.These fingers are intended to keep the shredded paper from staying on the shredding wheels. After a quick search on the web, it was easy to tell that this is not an uncommon problem with this product and that the company does not sell or provide replacement parts. If it had still been within warranty, I assume they would provide replacement coverage.I am a mechanical engineer by trade, and when I examined the design of these plastic fingers I would almost suspect that Fellowes was designing in a product life span to their product. These plastic fingers are obviously a wear item as they are stationary and in contact with the rotating shredding wheel axle. The plastic is thin at this location and as such, once the plastic wears through, the shredder is toast. At best, this is a design flaw. At worst, you make the call.I won't be buying another Fellowes product."]}

After 4 years of heavy use, our trusty b&w; HP laser printer died and we decided to go for a color printer. Since we recently got a digital camera, photo quality was a must. After much research, we considered buying a Canon, but went to a store to see if we could get any info about photo printing in general. A young man advised us to go for an HP, showing us pictures he'd taken and printed, and explaining some other points. We did some further research and the main complaint against the 940c was its' tendency to eat paper.We've had this printer for 3 weeks, and it did eat paper and printed unevenly until we discovered that a small door on the back, used to clear paper jams, was not fully closed. Going to HP's website, we learned that the paper guides must be snug and that it works best with stacks of photo paper, rather than 1-2 sheets of photo paper placed on a previous stack of plain paper. We have not had problems with paper feeds since.Overall, this printer is a fantastic value and provides the best bang for the buck you can get. The photo quality is indistinguishable from a 'real' photo. This, however, is dependent on the quality of the photo, as well as the paper used (we have had excellent results with HP's Premium Glossy paper). If the focus of the picture is slightly off, the print will look awful. The photos will look only as good as the original pictures. The plain paper text printing is surprisingly good as well, even in draft mode. Also, the print heads are part of the ink cartridges. This means that they are replaced when you replace cartridges and require no cleaning and less maintenance. As we've discoverd, replacing print heads can be expensive.Pros:* True photo quality* Excellent plain paper text printing* Non-photo printing is fast* Separate color & black ink cartridges* Printing heads are part of ink cartridgesCons:* Photo printing is not that fast, but the quality is worth it* A little bulky, but all inkjets are like that*UPDATE April 2003*Amazing - it still works like new! However, we we have covered our printer since day one as we have cats and wanted to keep the printer cat hair-free. This has also kept our printer dust-free, and we think it has made a difference. This printer has easily been amongst the best buys we have ever made."]}

Unfortunately, as noted by other reviewers, the auto-sensing feature is not very sensitive. If I turn down the volume on the PC to a pretty quiet level, the amp goes into standby and turns the speakers off.

I had placed it in a USB slot where it was braced solidly resting on the surface of my desk. The cutting out was not due to any movement or loose insertion in the slot. I tried changing USB slots but the problem persisted.I needed the eLicenser to run my new copy of Cubase Artist but I could not rely on it to get through a recording session without acting up. I found a USB slot where it seemed to work the most stable. I was able to use Cubase for a few days then the eLicenser started to cut out again.I contacted Steinberg Support. They had me testing things doing initialization and asked some questions but it seemed to me that the only viable solution was a replacement. No matter what they seemed to be focusing on, I could not depend on the device maintaining a working connection. I pointed this out and they set up an RMA.I shipped the eLicenser to Steinberg Support via USPS. They received it one business day later. At that point the Support tech I was corresponding with requested new activation codes from Steinberg Germany. I do not know why I needed new codes.With the eLicenser in their possession the tech sent new codes to me via email asking me to activate the products with the codes. However, without the eLicenser I could not do anything with the codes. I wrote the tech back reminding him that he had the eLicenser and it was supposed to be replaced. The tech then requested my address and apologized for \"the confusion.\" They already had my address, BTW, but I immediately sent my address in an email.From that point on I did not hear back from this tech or Steinberg. I have sent several follow up emails and filled out a new Support Ticket form describing the situation and only received automated email responses indicating they received them. A live person has not replied.I am stuck. I cannot use the software without the eLicenser. I cannot even use the Steinberg forum because you have to have the eLicenser running to post in the threads other than one which deals with forum issues exclusively.

First, let me point out a few things about the other reviews. The issues addressed in the other reviews are mostly due to people being lazy and ignorant about electronics. The major issues mentioned are the battery life and sticky buttons. Here are some facts:The battery is not Lithium Ion. It will develop a \"memery effect\" over time. That means if you put it on the charger for 5 minutes then pick it up and make a call and put it back on the charger, eventually you will have 5 minutes of battery life. The battery needs to be cycled occasionally to retain full battery life. All you have to do is let the battery drain as you use it for a few days and once it displays Low Battery, charge it overnight. A full discharge, charge cycle is a good habit to get into with anything rechargeable. I replaced the battery in this phone after 1 year and 4 months of solid use not because the battery was bad but because there was a longer life version out there. I still have the old battery and it still works.Sticky buttons are caused by sticky fingers. There is a small gap around the buttons which lets dirt and skin oils enter. This builds up over time and makes the buttons sticky. If the buildup is allowed to remain it will eventually get between the button and the internal contact and make the button stop working. The easy fix for this is to open the phone, clean it out and put it back together. The way to avoid this problem is to WASH YOUR HANDS! If you are making calls from the shower while your hands are wet or soapy, the water and soap will get in there. Changing your oil? Grease will get in there. Enjoying some wings while watching the game? Hot sauce will get in there. If it's on your hands it can get into the phone. Keep the phone clean and it will reduce the risk of the button issues.A cordless phone is like any other electronic equipment. It needs to be taken care of. If you take care of it, it will take care of you. Usually, people are too lazy to do some basic maintainance and then complain that the equipment is bad when the problem is related to misuse or neglect.I have had this phone for about 2 years with no problems at all. The battery life is good. Usually I get 4 or 5 days of regular use before needing a charge. The buttons work perfectly. I give the phone a quick wipe once in a while to keep it clean. The only issue I have with this phone is that it makes an audible beep when you dial a number from the base and there is no way to turn it off. Other than that it is a great phone. I've owned dozens of cordless phones over the past 15 years including GE, Casio Phone Mate, AT&T;, Itech and several others. GE is always the best."]}

I went looking for clocks and most on the market had wimpy alarms with chirping birds or other weak sounds that might be good for some folks, but deep sleepers like me need some serious decibels to wake us up. This clock delivered on both: Its alarm will sound even if power goes out for a few days and it's loud enough to wake people like me up. One thing I didn't expect, but now 6 years later, i came to love most about the clock is the uncanny accuracy it has. I remember unpacking it and only setting the time zone and the time showed up exactly as on my computer (which like most modern machines, is synchronized with the NIST atomic clock). I was expecting that once a year, i'd have to adjust the time to match the NIST clock because that's what i have to do with any wristwatches or alarm clocks i've had in the past. In the 6 years i've had it, i haven't had to adjust it even once... it's still within 3 seconds of the NIST clock (i'm obsessed with accuracy) and it even accounted for the change in daylight savings time that was introduced a few years after i got this clock... how it figured it out, i can only guess that they knew beforehand it was going to be a law, but it still surprised me. the clock has been so accurate that I've tried to read up and see if perhaps it's got a radio that synchronizes with the NIST clock, but short of opening it, i don't see evidence of an atomic clock sync radio. I'd give it 5 stars, except that in the 6 years, the switches for the alarms have begun to fail such that i need to move them carefully to get the alarm to turn on. Nevertheless, folks who are obsessed with accurate clocks can't go wrong with this piece... if Amazon doesn't carry it anymore, go look for it elsewhere... it's worth it!"]}

I had purchased a jump-o-lene ball pit for my 18 month old son. Within a few months it got a leak in it, but I had spent over $100 on ball pit balls so I desperately wanted something to put them in. I read the reviews on this product and decided to go with it. We have a fairly large play area so I wasn't concerned about the size.I have to say that I am very disappointed.PROS:This item was very easy to \"pop up\" and take down.CONS:Quality: The item is flimsy, which is to be expected from something like this, but so much so that my son basically tore it down before I could even get the balls in it. Anyone who has a \"rough and tumble\" child may not want to purchase this item. He is not especially destructive, but as soon as he figured out he could push the sides down, that is all he wanted to do.Size: This thing is HUGE. I ended up putting two parts away for now and left only the \"ball pit\" portion up.Set up: While it was easy to pop up the compartments, I found it difficult to set up in a pattern that worked for us. There needs to be a space on each side that you can attach a tube, but there are only 2 available sides on each compartment. I found that no matter how many different ways I tried, we were always putting one side against the wall that I wanted my son to be able to use (such as the basketball hoop). This may not be a problem if you are going to put this in the middle of a room, but if you plan to position it against a wall, you will likely have issues being able to utilize the features shown.Price: This item is very overpriced for the quality. I would expect to pay no more than $25 for something of this quality. Very disappointing.Overall enjoyment: My son really likes crawling through the tube at the park near our house so I thought he would really like this, but he wants nothing to do with it. That is no fault of the item, I guess, but he was not interested in it at all.Also, I should mention that the item I received was not exactly the same as the one pictured. The large ball pit compartment that is shown in the middle does not have the holes to put the balls through like it is shown, that is a part of a different compartment. The colors are different than pictured, also. For instance, the ball pit compartment is bright green on the side of the basketball hoop, not red as pictured.Overall, I would not recommend this product. I searched high and low for the perfect playland, but unfortunately this is not it."]}

I think this latter feature is a must on any modern radio and I use it often.The only downside I can think of is that method for setting some of the time functions is not highly intuitive.

When I called and complained they were true professionals and sent me another one, but the second one lasted almost the exact same amount of time the first one did. If descaling is such an issue then they should allow easier access to the interior components in order to clean it out.I have since found out that this is a common problem with the B50.

A honing steel is used to straighten the tiny rolls in a knife's edge. About 6-12 passes on each side of the knife will be sufficient for most knives to bring the slightly rolled edge back in line and return the knife to razor sharp. This only works if you don't allow your knife to get very dull. If it gets sufficiently dull you have to sharpen (remove metal) on stones or diamond plates/paddles, ceramic rods, or with another sharpening method. Honing, in contrast, does not remove metal. It straightens the rolled parts of the edge. If you hone each time after you've washed and dried your knife you will maintain the edge and won't have to sharpen it very many times per year.This honing steel does NOT have diamonds in the surface. It is a hardened steel rod that, being harder than the knife blade, is able to straighten the rolled edge. Honing steels with diamond particles remove metal and thus sharpen while straightening the edge as well. I recommend this type of honing steel because it allows you to simply straighten the edge instead of constantly removing metal, which shortens the life of a knife. I'm sure some people prefer a sharpening steel with diamonds, but I prefer one without them. If I want to sharpen I use 3M wet/dry silicon carbide sandpaper, a Wicked Edge Precision Sharpener or my Spyderco Sharpmaker. Using this honing steel after washing and drying the knife after use for food prep maintains the razor sharp edge. When the edge has been damaged too much to respond to honing it's time to resharpen the knife. Depending on the edge geometry and steel used in your knife you might need to sharpen once a month or as infrequently as once a year or less.This Kershaw steel is decently heavy, which is something you want. If the steel is too light you have to be careful to not let the knife move the steel, which could lead to accidental injury. If the steel is too thin it will wear out sooner. This one has a comfortable handle and the steel has good length and diameter to allow for easy, safe honing and for long term use. I got this on sale for $15. I wouldn't pay more than $20 for a honing steel when one like this can be had inexpensively and it will work well.Kershaw is a name brand of pocket knives. The brand is owned by KAI, which produces Shun kitchen knives, Kershaw pocket knives, and their more \"tactical\" line of pocket knives called Zero Tolerance, among other things."]}

The maximum frame size over USB is 320x240, which is half the minimum recommended for creating a DVD out of a home movie. If you want to get the video from your tapes onto a computer or DVD, expect to purchase a separate video capture device or card.To make matters worse, the bundled software doesn't let you capture more than thirteen minutes of video at a time before it crashes and claims the drive is out of disk space, regardless of how much disk space you really have avaliable. This happens even when recording to NTFS volumes, which do not have the 4 gig file size limit of Fat32.Most third party programs will also have issues using the camcorder's USB streaming features. The drivers create an eclectic audio device that many video capture programs can't see, so you'll have to use a separate audio cable unless you like the idea of not having any sound. Roxio's products are among the many that can't use the audio driver.In short, it's a decent camcorder, assuming you compare it to other devices as though the USB streaming feature didn't exist, because for all practical purposes, it doesn't."]}
