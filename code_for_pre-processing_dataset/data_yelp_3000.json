I went to Sam's Cafe last night with two of my girlfriends and based on my previous experience at the downtown location, I figured we'd get a pretty decent meal.  Not the case!\n\nCarter, our server, was awful.  I hate to be so hard on him but as soon as he took our drink order and we didn't order any alcoholic beverages, he went downhill from there.  My friend Allyson ordered the rotisserie chicken special and I ordered the applewood smoked pecan salmon.  DeDe had a few question before she decided and Carter not only had no clear answers for her, he didn't bother to try to get the answers.  Unacceptable!  (Just to clarify, these were basic questions such as 'what kind of vegetables come on the fire grilled vegetable tacos?' and 'What is the marinade for the chicken fajitas?')  \n\nThe next thing we know, we are given their special chips and salsa... I love how they combine sweet and salty in a colorful arrangement!  Those were delicious.  However, it was a good ten minutes until we saw our water and when you are eating salty chips and salsa, it's nice to have something to wash it down with!  Minus star #2.\n\nSo, our food comes and DeDe's fajitas are totally different than what Carter explained.  She isn't bitchy about sending them back but kindly asks for just the chicken and vegetables on a plate since that is what she was expecting.  This is where the 3rd missing star comes in - I am not kidding when I tell you that DeDe did not get her food until after both Allyson and I were done eating ours (and we were eating really slow)!  It was not right... and Carter was not very apologetic.  He came over to offer us a free dessert but being that we are all in healthy eating mode, we declined.  They did take the fajitas off the bill in the end, but it was expected at this point.\n\nSo, I know it was just one bad experience, but if I feel like Sam's Cafe again, I will probably head to the downtown location or just have lower expectations in the future.\n\nBottom line:  decent meal + bad service = 2 stars!"], "labels": [["Restaurants"]], "speaker_list": null}

Besides their tremendous skill, integrity, and generosity in teaching, they are wonderful people, full of humor, compassion, and intelligence. Their Tuesday night class at Hama Dance focuses on close embrace. On Sundays, students can take a 3-hour sequence of classes (or opt for just one or two segments) covering: (1) Stretching and technique, (2) milonga, and (3) tango, the latter usually focusing on open embrace movements.

So now it's 7 o clock on a Friday night and we have no reservations and everywhere we call has at least an hour wait....So I take over this situation and used Yelp power to find this place, which was lucky because they had open reservations and were very good. \n\nThe people who work here really know what they are doing. They are both friendly and professional. Our waiter Vinnie was great, he made very good suggestions when asked for them and was attentive. Additionally, their prices are extremely reasonable for the type of food offered and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere...very romantic (despite being in a casino). They make all of their pasta in house which is great, but it's kind of weird because they have a lady locked in a little red box with full length windows so you can watch her make pasta. I don't know how happy that would make me....but it is cool to see. Anyway, off of my tangent, we started with soup and salad (it comes with the meal) and they were good. I had the minestrone and, at first, I didn't like it because it was a bit thin, but after a few bites it was really good! The BF had the caesar salad with dressing on the side (he can't eat caesar dressing, but I can!) and it too was tasty. For mains, I had the filet (at Vinnie's recommendation) and it was really good. It is a filet on top of a 'risotto cake' aka fried cheesy goodness with spinach, mushrooms, and a balsamic glaze on it. I ordered the filet medium well because I am a crazy person about rare meat, but this kitchen sure knows how to cook a steak. It almost fell apart...so tender, not chewy at all, and had a lot of flavor. The BF got the porterhouse and it was good (but mine was better). I don't think he would order it again, only because other things on the menu are better, although It did come with the most buttery and tasty fingerling potatoes... really tasty. Again at Vinnie's recommendation (I'm glad he put up with me....), we got the ricotta cheesecake for dessert along with coffee. It was 4$ (for real?!?!) and it was soooo goood. It was creamy and sweet without being overly sweet. It had chocolate and caramel on it with raspberry (?) sauce underneath, fresh berries on the side, and a perfect quenelle (I totally had to look up that spelling... teehee) of whipped cream....and not just like redi-whip or something, but a thick, home made (tasting at least) whipped cream. \n\n\nReady for the most surprising part?

Bright drapery covering the sunny side of the building's windows. Lots of natural light in here and very inviting. The staff greeted us right away and asked us to order up at the counter, as they do not have menus printed yet. So, I assume that is coming. \n\nWe walked through the doorway into more of a kitchen area that had a counter setup and a large board with menu items. There are daily lunch specials, about 6-7 breakfast items, a lunch menu and a heafty list of specialty drinks. This place is really a true \"Asian\" Fusion, incompasing all of Asia.

Inside there were veggies (too many onions for me, I will omit them next time), including carrots, cilantro, and tomato. They give you a side of sweet chili sauce to top it. Other than the onions that I fished most of out, this was DELICIOUS. I am not sure how they did the egg, but I do not have to know. I just have to eat it. SG ordered a scrambled egg plate with stir fried asian veggies.

But once you pass through the smoky crowds and in to Verona, you are in a different place.  For new construction, they managed to pull off some old school steakhouse atmosphere.\n\nAs for the food:  Let's start with the premise that I don't like steak.  I never order steak.  I ordered a pasta dish and my fabulous wife ordered a surf' n 'turf special with a lobster tail and an 8 oz filet mignon.\n\nNext time I'm getting that.  I told our waiter Anthony that I don't really like steak but I would come back for that steak.  Since I would order it medium well, how would they prepare it?  Anthony told me that in that case they would butterfly the cut so that it could be done to my satisfaction yet retain its tender juiciness.  And the lobstah?  I lived in New England for about 3 years before arriving in Phoenix...I've had lobstah that is moments from the boat.  Verona served up a pretty good lobstah tail, particularly considering we are in the middle of the desert.  The roasted new potatoes and asparagus that came with this dinner were delicious as well.\n\nMy pasta consisted of penne pasta with a rather sweet tomato and cream reduction sort of sauce with Italian sausage and panchetta.  Very tasty but not fabulous.  In true form, this place is all about the steak.\n\nWe also shared a caesar salad which had a nice and authentic caesar dressing.  By authentic I mean that the anchovy flavor came through nicely.  Oh and it comes in a bowl made of fried cheese.  Seriously.  Take a bite of that bowl.\n\nThey have a nice wine list and I recommend the listed table red.  Good stuff.  \n\nWe shared tiramisu for dessert.  Again, very tasty and made authentic with mascarpone cheese, not custard.\n\nService was very good throughout.  My one small complaint was that my water glass went empty several times and it took a few minutes to get a refill.

Burger was overdone and not very juicy, and they left off the bacon and lettuce and tomatoes were smaller than the burger--not what you expect for a $11 burger.\n\nWife orders an ahi tuna salad vinaigrette on the side. Tuna was definitely cooked in the morning and refrigerated. It was dried out and scaly and they put the dressing on the salad anyways and put a second side of dressing.

One fork dip in the dressing was strong enough. $16 worth of salad that was really something you expect to get at a luxury vending machine.\n\nBeer was good, but she could have mentioned that they had a very limited draft list and that what I was ordering was a bottle.

As for the Ferrero cookie, it was everything I imagined it would be and more.  It was crispy on the edges and soft and delicious in the middle.  Nutella and a very generous amount of hazelnuts decorated the top.  It got a tad too sweet with the ample amount of hazelnut spread but I imagine it being perfect with a foamy latte.

One main decision I decided to go with her was the fact that she had on her site stating that she worked correcting permanent makeup done by inexperienced practitioners and knowing few ladies who have had 'permanent makeup gone bad', I figured she knew what she was doing.  What I did not expect was to have to get corrections done due to her work itself!\n\nI would like to point out in as much detail as I can on all information that I have to allow future potential clients to better make an informed decision about this business. I wish there was more review on this business but I was not able to find out any at the time so decided to go with her word from the website & good faith that she knew what she was doing with 15+ yrs experience. \n\nI had eyeliner done at Vanity on Mill Med Spa & Salon where Carlie & Marie Aesthetics was located at.  She had me lay down on the chair, rub some chapstick-like thing over my eyes (numbing cream) before starting.  She was not professional and did not win 1st impression with me as she was constantly on her phone texting pretty much the whole time I was in there! I would be talking & say something or ask her a question and  she wouldn't reply or say uh-huh so she wasn't even listing at all or paying attention as all I could hear was her tapping on the phone texting, VERY unprofessional! The procedure was painful but I endured it fine with minimal bleeding and the numbing cream did helped some.  I looked at the mirror after she was done & due to the puffiness of my lids, wasnt sure completely of it but it was lined, look dark from it being fresh. The liner wasnt lined all the way on the bottom so I asked about it but she said it was normal because she doesnt like getting too close to the tear duct.  left there sore but ok, though not too sure at the shape of the liner itself but figured like she said, it'll be better once it heals and to make sure I get the cream & pills for a fast recovery.\n\nWoke up with very puffy & swelled up eyes but figured that was normal so continued to put the cream on & ice pack helped the swelling after about an hr.  After careful inspection of my eyes, I noticed that the liners on the top were not even as one side was very noticeably thicker on the corner vs the other & both the bottoms were not only not drawn from corner to corner but only the middle was drawn & one line on one eye was shorter than the other. I contacted about this concern in which I got a reply back 2 days later & was told that I would have to go in for a touch up & pay an extra $$ which I was not too happy with as the next day (day 3), I had other problems.  My eyeliner was still puffy some but it started peeling is the best way to described it. After a shower, in the morning & also after my routine face wash (which I was extremely careful with around the eye area), I noticed that pieces were coming off! It was as if the makeup application was lined on my lashes. The next day, (day 4), more came off and this time, my eye liner still had that puffy line BUT the lines from where the pieces were coming off had disappeared!  So by this time, I was really concerned and wanted to talk to her as to why this was happening. I was told sometimes it does a 'disappearing act' where the color will come back and that it is normal and the touch up is what I needed. Now, I know that the color is supposed to fade after the initial procedure, even as much as 60% but not this disappearing act. I had a hard time believing that if I cannot see any lines, that it would come back. I also had called numerous permanent makeup estheticians for a 2nd opinion. Some told me she might of not used a good 'ink'. I also learned that follow ups are the norm but not always needed depending on the work. Most include it in their initial price while others do not. Unfortunately, touch up was not included in hers.  I finally talked to someone who was very professional & unbiased and told me to go back to her to do the touch-up & hope it corrects it since I now have that pigment from the 1st procedure, the color should stick the 2nd time around.  Well, after the 6th day of procedure, I can honestly say, my eyes looked as if I had nothing done to them (except the little liner on the corner on top where it was thicker if you look closely and the pain I'd endured) as the peeling of the liners are gone (like dead skin) & I'm out the $. I still had some faith (wishful thinking) she could fix it so I booked my appt with her for the touchup. The lines she drew was messy & uneven but since my eyes were puffy, I gave it time.

They always seem to have some sort of special on, which is great for students.  They have a $10.99 AYCE menu (albeit VERY limited), and a $14.99 AYCE which includes sashimi (2 or 3 types).  They also have \"FREE DAYS\", where each day of the week, you get something free with your meal (ie. tofu & miso on Sundays).\n\nBoth times I have been there, service has been brutal.  There were times that the waitress was just sitting at a table with her head down, and one of the chefs would come over to serve us after our failed attempts to get her attention.\n\nThe first visit, I ordered \u00c3\u00a0 la carte, and the food came out beautifully prepared and displayed.  (see picture I will be uploading)\nThe second visit, which was AYCE, it was as though they couldn't care less.  It was all just laid on a big plate in rows.  The salmon sashimi came out in super thin slices, yet all still stuck together by some fatty tissue at the corner.  I have never seen sashimi cut so poorly in my life!  And the fish just did not seem like sushi grade.  I was so disgusted, I didn't re-order anything but basic rolls.  But even the spicy salmon roll was purely mushy, and it appeared that the chef hadn't cleaned his prep area between preparing rolls.  Rolls that weren't supposed to have fish eggs on them had a few scattered bits of tobiko around the outside, that clearly didn't come from just being on the plate.  It's so important for sushi chefs to use clean surfaces when preparing different rolls or fish.   For a second time, I was disgusted.\n\nThe interior is a cold blue, and the lighting is just as unwelcoming.  I think they've installed fluorescent lighting panels on the walls, and put transparent images of bamboo over them, as if they could act as sconces.  FAIL\n\nWe overheard a diner behind us asking the waitress to recommend something delicious he hadn't tried before, and she suggested the dynamite roll.  I couldn't believe it.  The customer looked pretty disappointed too.  If I had to rank the million sushi places on Bloor, Mariko would be wayyy down on my list.  If you're going to try it, my only advice is not to go for the AYCE.  It's just not worth it in the end if you can't enjoy your meal.  Part of the joy of sushi is the presentation and preparation.  It should be a feast for the eyes as well, and Mariko seems to think that it's alright to offer an inferior meal to their AYCE customers.\n\nLater found out they had a conditional pass back in April '09.

She hands me two of the smallest ice coffees I have ever seen. I asked the cashier with an attitude if it was actually a medium because I am in shock as to how small it is. She grabs it out of my hand and holds the cup up while pointing to a small M on the side of it. I tasted both of the shit coffees they gave me. One tasted like chocolate milk and the other one tasted like straight espresso. What I ordered was two iced French Vanilla lattes, add mocha and add an extra turbo shot. I literally order this from a couple different McDonald's and know it's something they make. So. I then ask the bitch cashier to see a manager because at this point I'm just furious. She informs me the lady that made my coffees was my manager but her gm was also there. So I asked to speak to him. She stands there just yelling his name. I literally laughed to myself. The gm comes out from the back.

Like. I'm an assistant gm. I have been a gm. You do NOT come in and act like that as a gm. I ask him if he can remake my coffee because they are not correct and taste like shit.

I thought it was ridiculous that my wife would be boxing a heavy bag but whatever. She ended up going for about 3 weeks and already lost a couple pounds and was putting up quite a bit! So she dragged me into their club and I admit that I begrudgingly went.   My workouts at the YMCA were just fine i thought.  Crap was I wrong.   I was lucky enough to meet the owner, Casey, on site.  Man is he a motivated fellow. \n\nYou have to buy wraps (they are needed, trust me) for $8.  I ended up owning about 5 pair now!  I used the borrow gloves; and have my own pair now. (On the second pair as we speak).  The first workout nearly killed me in the just the warmup.  I was literally dripping sweat.  I had no idea how to box but the instructor took the time to show me the jabs, crosses, hooks...took me a while to get up to speed.  You were allowed to modify as needed.  I broke my ankle years ago and built up scar tissue and pain prohibited me from doing much of anything.  I've since broken through all that scar tissue and can sprawl, mountain climb, and jump rope like a champ.  The owner, Casey, personally motivates his members and seems to know all of them by name. \n\nI've gone many times, and visited clubs in different cities, and I go as often as I can...5-6 times per week.  I have my favorite instructors and enjoy the interaction and time with them.  My wife was lost dress sizes and pounds and we've brought many friends with us to this club.  Personally I've lost pants size, pounds, and gained shoulders and chest muscles and abs; finally.  It's a great time, great workout and well worth my time.\n\nThis club is ALWAYS clean, smells nice, lots of stock, and a low turnover of trainers.

My boyfriend and I went along with my parents (who love mid century modern furniture) just to look as I am moving soon and can't buy any furniture until I relocate, but this shop made me want to move to downtown Phoenix and fill my house with everything in this shop. My thrift-genius parents taught me to buy antique furniture and never ever ever buy new, as new furniture is expensive to buy and cheaply made. Modern on Melrose is fantastic proof of this - my boyfriend fell in love with a yellow leather and wood 70s couch and noticed that this beautiful couch cost less than a couch our friend recently bought at IKEA. And no one is going to buy IKEA couches in antique stores 40 years from now, because they barely last 1 move. \n\nEverything in this store is gorgeous and there is a great variety of furniture and random decor goods. We ended up buying some great stacking canisters as a gift, and the very helpful employee dashed back to the area we got them and told us they were 40% off. We debated keeping the canisters because they were as affordable as they were quirky and useful and interestingly designed, but the Christmas spirit prevailed and we decided to give them to their original recipient.\n\nThe same employee discussed style and furniture things with my father in a very helpful and absolutely non pretentious way, which is a refreshing and fun element of any antique store. I always want to talk to the employees but very often feel they are too busy or want to sound smarter than me (which they are, but I'm not buying anything if the person I'm giving money to makes me feel stupid).

I always start every meal a nice bowl of a couple of 'tons. lol. \n\nBut the real attraction for me is the Sushi Bar!! Their sushi is real hit or miss... but is more hit than miss... and since it comes with the meal - it's worth atleast taking a gander at. Their salmon nigiri is always good when in stock, as is their shrimp nigir - but I have had a couple of pieces of bad tuna nigiri, which disappoints me but I still go back and give it a go.

Tja, was soll ich sagen - auf Stuttgarts architektonischer Gruselmeile namens Heilbronner Stra\u00c3\u009fe fiel mir irgendwann das Altbauensemble positiv auf, und das Design des Eingangs wirkte ansprechend. Und es waren auch nirgends verwertbare Kritiken zu finden...

The best part about it, other than being completely FREE, is that it isn't a set course or distance so everyone, regardless of ability, can participate. You start off by going through a mini expo and trying out gear, tasting samples, or checking out various local races and you get to earn raffle tickets as you go along. Then, they drop a map and it's up to you to find as many of those checkpoints listed as possible in an hour to get even more raffle tickets. Fast runners can go the distance and get a great, fun workout, while walkers are still able to get to the closer checkpoints. At the end of the hour, everyone returns to Road Runner Sports for a huge raffle! The prizes never disappoint and always include a free pair of shoes for some winners! I also love that you can get delicious craft beer at this event for $1 a pint and that all goes to charity! Let's face it, what other point is there to running than having a cold beer at the end. I can't imagine a better way to spend an otherwise boring Thursday night! All the runners are so friendly and it's so easy to meet new people and make new friends! I always recommend it to people who are new in town and this is Phoenix; there's always someone new in town ;-)\nMy tip would be to register ahead of time to get an extra raffle ticket at check in. \nThey also have this event at the Scottsdale store so that makes for 2 great Thursdays a month!"], "labels": [["Active Life", "Arts & Entertainment"]], "speaker_list": null}

I stood at the bar (dead center, with no one standing in front of me) for over 5 minutes before the bartender even took my order.

I went last week hoping to discover an exciting new aspect of the Valley's cultural ascendance but I left feeling totally bummed. The whole scene felt like a sort of bizarro reverse Scottsdale Fashion Square counterculture. Like day vs night, conformists vs non-conformists, capitalists vs social anarchists.  I felt like I was engulfed by people trying so hard not to fit in that they somehow managed to become clones of themselves. And you know what sucks about the whole thing?... I'll bet there are dozens of extremely talented young artists whose work is completely overwhelmed by sheer sensual overload of this spectacle. A perfect example would be this fantastically talented young girl singing and playing guitar. She couldn't be more than 16 years old. Great voice. About 35 feet away there was loud punk rock band jamming away completely drowning out our fresh faced heroine. Or, was it the opposite? Maybe I was the one who was wrong and it was my youthful singer whose little amplifier managed to get in the way of an even more talented band, maybe Phoenix's version of Social Distortion or the Misfits? Either way, I was totally disoriented....... and bummed.  \n\nI felt the same way about the conventional art on display. I made a concerted effort to find unique works, possibly a piece that really resonated with me that I would want to see on a wall in my home. Instead 90% of what I saw there reminded me of the doodles and art class projects that my friends and I used to create when our lives were devoted to playing Dungeons and Dragons and watching Hellraiser marathons on VHS.  \n\nOn a side note, is it just me or do young people who devote their lives to blood, gore, pain and suffering annoy anyone else?

We were also given a small bowl of spiced olives.

When it came, I felt a pang of regret since it didn't look very appetizing. The colour was quite dark and the ravioli was deconstructed (i.e. not stuffed). The square sheets of pasta just sat on top of the veal/ricotta mixture. Luckily the taste made up for its lack of appearance. The taste of the veal was delicious... extremely flavourful. I just wish it was actually stuffed inside the pasta. Nevertheless... a delicious dish!\n\nMy other friend ordered the Papardelle alla Bolognese ($18). The bolognese was made of veal and pork. I was quite impressed - it looked and tasted great. Another hit!\n\nWhile the dishes we tried were delicious, the portions weren't very big.

My friend and I managed to talk the doorman down to $4 for the two of us. Perhaps he was desperate to get more ladies into the establishment. Perhaps he's just a chump.\n\nIn either case, you'll be interested to know that while waiting in the parking lot for my friend's boyfriend to show up, I witnessed the doorman using your $7 to help pay for a pizza and hot sandwich from Dominos. \n\nUnlike some of the other ladies in our party, I will not complain about the ass-grabbing and creepy smiles I received.

Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy, but smooth flavor. The meat was fall off the bone tender. \n\nPiggy back dates -- a must have. dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and then in a bed of white mousse. Come on!

The food was very good and we will definitely be back. We had cheese curds as an appetizer. They were tasty, but they are breaded and then deep fried and served with a sauce. The sauce was a wonderful tomato-jalapeno-fruit sauce (can't fully identify the fruit), and it may have some roasted red pepper.  Truly good sauce.  The curds themselves were unexceptional. Too much breading, but that seems common in this part of the country.  (We prefer curds warm and \"naked\" with a spice \"rub\" rather than a sauce. But I'm not complaining. They were good.)\n\nThe main courses likewise were really good. The pork tacos had ample seasoned pork, cilantro, onions, and (oddly) sour cream. But the mix of flavors was very good, and I added the green salsa (that came with the chips) to mine.  The squash tacos were a real surprise, especially at a restaurant like this. They were spicy and perfectly done. Both taco dishes came three to a plate on soft corn tortillas.  The crisp was billed as a Mexican pizza-- a flour tortilla filled with cheese and toppings. Not quite a tostada, so Mexican pizza is probably as good a description as any.  It was piled high and easily shared. And, most important, it was delicious.\n\nThe chips and salsa were good. The salsa, in fact, was very good. Especially the hot salsa. It was a tomatillo salsa but with lots of peppers but still not really hot.  The red salsa was billed as mild, and it was. None in our party found it exceptional.  The chips were warm and very salty. I couldn't tell for certain, but I don't believe they are made on the premises.  \n\nThe menu is relatively large and broad, ranging from tilapia to steak to tacos and burritos. And there are many choices in each category. Carnivores and vegetarians both will find things on the menu, though vegan vegetarians may not find much.  It isn't really Mexican; if you are looking for authentic Mexican you should go to Maize or El Charro. The food here is Mexican Inspired. I'm not knocking it. It is delicious. The steaks and seafood with Mexican spices were amazing, and they have a greater variety of tacos than do the more authentic places. The chefs may have worked in a steakhouse as they really know how to cook the steaks.  And the spices and sauces add to the flavors rather than smothering or overwhelming the meats or vegetables. \n\nThe place has one other feature that many of our Mexican style restaurants lack: a lovely decor. Although says Cantina and Grill on the sign, this is a sit-down restaurant if you want it to be.  On the side away from the bar it has normal tables, while the bar area has service at the bar and at those \"tall tables\" that require high chairs to sit at.  The decor is simple but very nice, the music was quite low and we could easily talk over it.  There are several TVs and I suspect it serves as a nice sports bar on game days.  \n\nThe wait staff was wonderful. They would explain any dish you might have questions about, and they make recommendations if you give them guidelines about what you are looking for in a meal.  Very professional and amazing given that they've only been open for a week.  \n\nParking is ample and we were seated immediately. The waitress took our drink order less than five minutes after we were seated, and the drinks arrived promptly, as did the chips and salsa, and both were refilled quickly and without our needing to ask.\n\nAll in all, I think this place is off to a great start in Champaign!

The leftovers (which didn't really fit into the chinese leftover box I was given) will be wonderful tomorrow a.m., I'm sure!\n\nHubby had a baked breakfast casserole. It smelled delish and he claims it was wonderful. It had spinach, chorizo, egg, tomato and cheese (and other stuff i'm sure) and was baked. It looked a bit runny, but after mixing it all together and slathering it on top of the home fries (which he claimed were good), it lost its runny appearance. Go figure!\n\nI felt that the room could have used some sound deadening, as the group at the other table was a bit loud, but the front door was open and the street noise was non-existent. Cute atmosphere...all IKEA, all the time!\n\nOur check was exactly $20 without tip/tax, so I felt like it was a successful outing. Great weather, great food, good (if not slow) service. \n\nI look forward to a return visit to try other menu items, as many looked like stuff right up my alley!"], "labels": [["American (New)", "Restaurants"]], "speaker_list": null}

The promise of a relaxing experience started off poorly with the locker room so crowded that it reminded us of a public restroom amidst a holiday celebration. There was not enough room to put one's bag down, forget about changing in dignity without having someone's hair or wet towel constantly brushing against you. Next we headed to the wirlpool to finally wind down. Well, as i was trying to say a quiet word to my friend, a guard came out running to give me the warning that no talking was allowed. We said ok, we ll try our best. Then as one of us was wispering something about his experience with the spa, the guard rushed back to tell us that now we are given a second warning since silence is to not only be practiced but to be enforced upon all the club visitors. Apparently, my duty was to keep my mouth shut so a) others could enjoy - i suppose silence is the uttermost ingredient of enjoyment in this particular spa and b)  those having massage upstairs would not be bothered by our conversations. To top it off, the guards would stand around the pools and stare at the people to enforce the 'silence rule' which certainly was not only aggravating but rather inappropriate for an environment that was to relax your body and soul.  Maybe if this was a prison spa, i would accept it but hey you dont pay an entrance fee in that type of setting. \nAngry and frustrated, we asked the guards about the part of the spa where talking was allowed. Sufficient to say that it was the case on just about 10% of the property where we headed to looking to finally relax and enjoy ourselves. Indeed once there we could certainly chat freely while taking a pleasant dip in the only pool available that for some sad reason resembled a glorified home tub and as such could accomodate somewhere in the range of 6-8 people - unless we were willing to climb on top of each other or stand shoulder to shoulder with the strangers - which believe me, we were not going to do. Having had enough, we decided to leave. Oh if only that was easy. Getting through the overcrowded locker took the last bit of energy and made all of us wonder who and why woud ever go to polar bear in search of relaxation???

Since we could put my son in swimming lessons there for no extra cost, we just went there. However, my son has a bit of apprehension in the water. He gained some skills in their lessons, but he was stagnating over time.\n\nWe've known a few people who enrolled their children at Making Waves, and one thing I knew right off the bat that would make them ideal is the max of 3-1 child to teacher ratio. I can't emphasize enough how important that is, as I watched my son at his previous lessons have to wait several minutes at a time for his turn when there were about 5 in his class.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the instruction is also at a high level. One example is previously my son was learning to float by having the teacher hold him under his shoulders and pull them along the water. Here, the teacher actually helps support him more under his lower body. It makes sense, as the upper body is where the body floats, with the lower body being prone to sink being only muscle and bone. This technique seems to give the student a better sense of learning how and then trusting their body to float. They also do a great job of helping push students just outside of their comfort zone. Enough to encourage learning, but not enough to scare them too much. For example, for some of the lessons you'll see the teachers count loudly to 5 as the student is doing their best to stay afloat when swimming,which seems seems a reasonable amount of time for them to push through, without worrying about being under too long.\n\nTerrific facility as well, with a huge viewing area to watch the lessons, a play area for kids who may be waiting, and a nice change area. A terrific thing about this place is that they use salt water as a natural cleanser/disinfectant for the pool rather than chlorine. It improves the smell, but I'm sure it's better for skin too.\n\nIt is naturally more costly to attend here than most other places. I can't fault them for that given the details above; but I wish they'd offer the 10% discount for the second child rather than only if you have 3 attending. Many don't have 3 kids to begin with, and I think a 10% is still a fair deal if family have 2 children attending given the cost.\n\nIt is what it is, but ultimately, everything is at a high standard.

I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste. The chili was GROSS! Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe....it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat. \n\nThe soup of the day came out.....again.....GROSS!!!! Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they \"of the dayified\" the soup pot by adding a block of salt. VERY gross. I eat EVERYTHING no matter what. I dd NOT eat this.\n\nSpaghetti comes out. Giant portion for a kid but one can't complain about that. Sad-looking but no bog whoop. She enjoyed it.....she's 5. \n\nThe roast beef and mashed potatoes come out. Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes.....no big whoop. Not my cup of tea but they can;t be that bad. The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE! It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all. Gross but let's press on.\n\nWhile that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the \"chef\" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the \"sauce\" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce. There was some kind of muttering of acknowledgement and the waitress let me know that there was a problem and that my meal would be out shortly. \n\nThe \"chef\" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it \"Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles\"!!!! Wrap your brain around that! So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out....unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me. MMMMMMMMM!!!!! Then I look down. It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me.....ok, I'm not a debutante...I'll tough it out. \n\nI sliced into the first meatball. I took a bite. It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled. It was gross. The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it. \n\nThe waitress came over shortly after and asked how everything was. I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals but would not feed these things to a stray dog. I let her know this was the first time I ever said this dining out. \n\nShe asked if she could take something off the check? First off, the right thing to do is to just apologize and comp the meal....I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense but she just needs to stop). \nSo we all got up and walked toward the register. This is how we found out that the register is new......\nSo I was charged a little over 20 bucks. I handed the waitress 2-20s and asked if I could just have a 10 back. This was a problem. She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way. She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery. Losing it to say the least. I felt bad at first but then she started to smack the register each time a button press was unsuccessful....kinda in a way when you first find out your girl is a little bit kinky but you aren't quite sure what that means."], "labels": [["Restaurants"]], "speaker_list": null}

{"dialog_length": 1, "dialog_list": ["The only reason this place gets two stars is because of the food.\n\nWe were there June 6, and around 830PM, we decided to walk in the Verona Restaurant, since we wanted a nice dinner for my husband's birthday.\nThe hostess that sat us promptly was gracious, and said someone would be there shortly with water.\n\nWe waited about 5 minutes for water. Our waiter Peter must of been having an off night, or support staff wasn't there. I cannot think of too many reasons for how were treated during our meal there.\n\nFirst of all, the ambiance of the restaurant is nice, the booths just a bit nicer with the nice leather seating. The ceiling has a nice alabaster light, but it seemed to be right on our table. Perhaps at a later hour they dim the lights?\nBefore we were even acknowledged by Peter, our waiter, or anyone with a glass a water was probably a good 5-6 minutes after we sat down. At least get a person a glass of water. \nWhen Peter came over, we had plenty of time to review the menus, as the hostess had given those when we first sat down. Peter ran through the menu, offered to get drinks. My husband decided on water, and I requested a cup of coffee with cream.\nWe placed our order, hubby had the NY steak with the Potatoes Rustica, and I had the 8oz Ribeye with Baby Vegetables(broccalini).\n\nThe redeeming quality of this place WAS the food. I had to ask for my coffee again, I was just about done with dinner. We were NEVER EVEN ASKED ONCE HOW OUR FOOD WAS. NOT ONCE. \nI am so disappointed in this place. I thought we might of found a nice, dress up nice and have a celebration dinner, as my husband wanted a casino night for his birthday.\nIt seemed our bread came late... while the rolls are good, you get a couple, I hesitated to even think of asking for any more.\n\nOur water glasses were never refilled(glasses completely OUT of water), wait-staff never asked how things went with us.... ANYTHING to acknowledge that we were even there. I believe it was the manager that refilled our glasses about 5 minutes before we left.\n\nPerhaps we weren't high-rollers? I don't know the answer to that one. I do know that the party next to us, had a wonderful waitress, and she communicated with them.\nWe never asked for anything out of the ordinary, we were dressed appropriately for a nice restaurant, and we have dined in nice places before, and never been treated so poorly.  We never demanded anything, didn't order something not on the menu, we weren't demanding in any way shape or form.  \n\nWAIT! We asked for bread after the salad arrived, maybe that was it?? We had been there around 30-35 minutes when we requested bread..We almost had consumed the salad and from experience, you usually will get a selection of bread. Although, once the bread arrived, Stephen did an awesome job preparing the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was good.\n\nI think that perhaps they realized that things were basically not salvageable, as Peter said when he dropped off the dinner check, and hurried off, \"the coffee is free\" said as he passed by the table. Weird.\n\nI wouldn't go back to the restaurant. I had hoped for a place where you are treated well, and the food good.\n\nI have to say that the prices, I thought we reasonable, my 8OZ  Ribeye was 17, with one side included. We ordered an In Casa Ensalta(sp) - 8- which was pretty good. \n\nThe food isn't the problem, at least not on June 6, 2009, it was either the staffing wasn't sufficent - it should've of been...

I could have gone with Sarah Miller (appeared on Ink Master on Spike TV) but instead chose to go with Ryan Clark.  When I told Ryan what I was looking for, he looked at the design and tried to put this together.  When he looked at it and tried to piece it together, he told me that he could do it but he thought it wouldn't look like I would want it too.  He told me that he would do it if I wanted it done but he also said he wanted to talk to me to make sure that my tattoo was the best representation of what I was looking for.  \n\nHe changed the design based on our conversation and then sent me a basic outline of the tattoo via email (this way I didn't have to drive all that way just to see it).  When I came it, he was very professional and you could see that he put his heart into his work.  He took lots of time to make sure the details were right and it was great.  In the end, I love the detail that he put into the tattoo and the recommendations he had.  The tattoo looks way better than what I was thinking and am very happy that I chose him.\n\nOn a side note, there were 2 other experiences that happened when I was there which were interesting.  First, a woman came in looking for a cover up tattoo.  She asked about getting it covered and was told that because it was so dark, it would be hard to cover it up.  They mentioned that they could do it but only a few things would cover it up.  They also gave her other options about what to do with it, including getting laser treatment to lighten up the tattoo.  Then they could do more with a cover up tattoo.  I thought it was good that they gave her options instead of just looking to tattoo her and take her business.  They seem to care about the art going on the body as it's a reflection of them.\n\n2nd experience, a guy came in and wanted his eyelids tattooed.  They all said that they weren't really interested in that type of tattoo and again, that told me that they weren't there just to tattoo anyone anywhere.  I think it's good for a shop to do things like that.\n\nAll in all, I thought it was a great experience and will contact Ryan about my next tattoo."], "labels": [["Coffee & Tea", "Food", "Bars", "Nightlife"]], "speaker_list": null}

There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside.\n\nwe ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg.

Couple of the ladies in our group were doing some research before picking which place to go, so they called ahead to find out the deal - they were told Extreme Bowling is $17 per person (plus tax).  It starts at 8pm and that price includes shoes and all-you-can-bowl.  All of this is true...until 10:30pm.  What we were not told was that $17 is for 8p-1030pm, at which point they empty the place out and start over again, and you can pay an additional $17 for 10:30-1:30.  Not knowing this, we arrived shortly before 9pm.  Sorry, but we're not going to pay $17 for an hour of bowling, then repay it again for the rest of the night.  The cashier was a nice enough kid, this really wasn't his fault.  But they were not bending on the rules either.  I can understand, but let's mention that little detail when people call and ask.

As you would expect the walls are covered in Irish icons; rugby shirts, road signs and Guinness adverts and the staff are largely Irish.

Since these are large tables it is common to share them with other patrons, which depending on your view of meeting people, can be a curse or a blessing. \nThe drinks are typically priced for the centre of Edinburgh, with a pint of lager costing around \u00c2\u00a33. However, the main advantage to Dropkick's is that you can still be served up until around 3am, which means that if you are kicked out of another bar and do not feel ready for bed, or in the mood for a club, you can still have a drink in Dropkick's. In saying that, the music can sometimes be too loud for a conversation with anyone but the person sitting next to you.

Anyway, I ordered an iced latte as well the french toast with fruit and my bf ordered the croque monsieur.\n\nI went to wash my hands and noticed how dark and dirty the corridors leading into the kitchen were. The bathroom stank!! Then I saw someone, who I later found out was the manager, walking from the storage area to the kitchen with my french toast in a see through plastic bag. I then saw him put it in a microwave in the grotty kitchen. $11. French toast. MICROWAVED?!\n\nStupidly, I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and didn't say anything. My iced latte arrived. It had espresso, and cold milk, topped off with HOT FROTH and NO ICE. Seriously? Not only is that disgusting, it's also dangerous - hot and cold milk should never be mixed. When I worked at Starbucks this was the first thing we were taught - never accommodate any customer who wants hot foam on an iced espresso drink. It tasted horrible and the server seemed confused when I asked for a mug of ice to help make the drink actually, yknow, ICED.\n\nThe food arrived. The french toast was as gross as it looked in that plastic bag. It was soggy, flat and worst of all - STALE. the watermelons that came with it would have needed a steak knife to cut. My bf is NOT a fussy eater, but took one bite into his sorry looking croque madame (think microwaved ham and cheese on white bread) and said ''do you want to just leave?''.

They didn't even protest, offer us anything else or defend themselves for charging $11 for microwaved french toast. After asking us for a bit of clarification, they simply said ''sorry, ok'' and shrugged their shoulders.

I've also stayed here a couple of times before my last stay.  The other reviews are right on the money about the owner and the staff.  John Hessling clearly understands customer service. It is the reason why I booked a stay there a few days while the moving truck where I was relocating from was en route to Vegas.\n\nThere is also an unnecessary snarky side to the operation and seems to prevail staff-wide. Asking for extra towels or to let a guest's visitor into the property within a reasonable amount of time (was my brother-in-law, not a trick), is not an extraordinary request.  I can understand why one would feel bothered if the room was comped.  But it wasn't. I think the owner and staff have lost sight of the fact that guests are choosing to stay there rather than the Wynn (where it was cheaper for the time of my stay at Blue Moon).  When inquiring about certain clubs, I was told by the staff at the front desk they weren't allowed to promote some of them and were directed to send me to certain venues. Not illegal, nor a surprise. But pretty crappy way to deny a guest an experience.\n\nMr. Hessling also has a blog where he pens somewhat bitchy copy under the name PERSON OF INTEREST and runs a hook-up app called Bent, which, though I indulge in both, is probably hurting his attention to the details at the Blue Moon.   Sadly, it is unlikely I will come back here, nor recommend it, until it gets back into the the tip-top shape it once was--and can be again.\n\nAs for the neighborhood, this is all subjective.

{"dialog_length": 1, "dialog_list": ["Every once in awhile I have a meal at a restaurant that exceeds all my expectations, and it happened recently in of all places, Montreal, Canada.  In a city known for smoked meat and french fries loaded with gravy and cheese I had one of the best meals ever at Propulsion Cantine Vegetalienne. A Vegan restaurant  with an Airplane theme on the famed Saint Catherine's Street.  From the menu to the decor, from the waitress to the owner, this place is funky, fresh and entirely unexpected. Simone and I brought some friends with us who were Vegan and we actually arrived about twenty minutes before closing. I was a little nervous that the service and the food would be sub par because of the time of night but we were happily greeted on arrival by the quirky and funky waitress whose name I cant remember but whose personality I can never forget. She was more then willing to talk our ears off about the entire menu and about their new restaurant that has only been open since mid summer 2013.  The decor is aviation themed including a mannequin of a 1950's pilot and many parts of an actual propeller plane that had crashed and the owner had bought and turned into the bar and some seating tables.  It is all very cool to look at while waiting for the food.  Speaking of food, we decided after speaking with the waitress that we would just let her decide what to eat and so she started us off with a sample of a cool and refreshing cucumber smoothie. From there the four of us split a create your own bowl.  This was a imaginative concept where you choose a combination of grains, vegetables, and sauces. We went with a Pesto Bowl and had Quinoa, Bean Based Pesto, and fresh grilled Zucchini and roasted Cauliflower in it. Although completely dairy free, and thickened with garbanzo beans, this was the best Pesto I have had. It was creamy, nutty and garlicky great. The quinoa and vegetables were cooked perfectly as well and this was a great start to the meal.  Next we wanted to explore the sandwich menu (all sandwiches come with tempeh in them and of course your choice of fresh, moist, light vegan breads) .They all sounded so good our waitress suggested we split a variety of them and she would be sure the kitchen would cut them into portions for us. I didn't think it would get much better after the Pesto but these sandwiches were just over the top great.  The choices we went with were the Lentil Cari sandwich ( my personal favorite), The Mungo Mango ( voted by my friends to be the best), and The Purple Taro Portabello (still good but third on the voting scale). The Lentil Sandwich on Turmeric Bread was tempeh with a lentil patty that had a hint of curry and spice and just the right amount of smokiness, The patty held together on the outside and when you bit in the lentils were cooked perfectly tender but not mushy.  I have never had lentils that tasted so good in my culinary life and the only thing that upset me about this sandwich was that I had to share it with the rest of the table. It was my absolute favorite. Next up was the Mungo Mango. This was also pretty good and consisted of Chinese Mung Beans and Fresh Mango's  with tempeh on Fig Bread...It was earthy and sweet and everyone at the table loved it also. Lastly was the Purple Taro Portabello.  It was also good (and very purple) with mashed taro and sauteed mushrooms with tempeh but I found it to be a little soggy and less flavorful then the other sandwiches.  By the time we ate all the food it was past closing but when we asked the waitress if she wanted to cash us out to help with closing she told us not to worry about it and then she went and ate her own dinner.  We ended up staying for awhile longer and chatting amongst ourselves and with her and it was only when the kitchen (and pilot outfitted owner) had started to leave that we got our check. On the way out we took some vegan cookies with us for the road and they of course were great.  That night I dreamed of Lentil Sandwiches and so the next night Simone and I went back for another helping of sandwiches, pesto and good conversation with our friendly waitress. There was also a great piano player that second night who was amazing and we ended up staying again until closing. Everything about Propulsion is five stars, in the future they will be adding Vegan alcoholic drinks and fresh local salads.

I have, for the most part, shunned all AMF lanes, minus the one on Christown, which has sentimental value because that was where I pretty much grew up bowling. This alley, much alike most AMF's, has horrid service, from staff that range of their mid teens to their late 20's and many whom despite their bowling background know nothing about how to treat the customer right. Most people know that lanes always staff people whom for the most part have a pretty big bowling background. That's a major plus when hiring. Unfortunately, like I said, they suck at servicing the customer.\n\nAlso, the lanes and the area around are really poor. Like one person stated before me, they have old screens, which is not the case at any Brunswick bowling alley you may go to. The floor boards are extremely slippery, and it can easily cause injury if you're foolish enough to run around on the approach, let alone go over the foul line. The food is comparable to all other publicly traded bowling alleys: its over-priced and is horrible for you....DON'T EAT IT! Drink prices aren't too bad considering where you are at, but its still bad. Bowling prices are always market rate...If you simply go on AMF's main company website you can get coupons to lessen the $$ you are spending. There is no reason to not sign up on a bowling mailing list and get coupons, they save you A LOT! \n\nWith all this said, I give it 2 stars. Its not the worst alley in town, although close to it. It needs MAJOR renovations, even something simple like getting new TV's would mean so much. Renovate, and you will see more business... I recommend you go elsewhere until they do just that. Go to privately owned and operated Let It Roll Bowl, just a bit down, with better rates and service. Go to pretty much any Brunswick, which will do much better on each level.

The restaurant advertises the night as running from 6pm 'til 9pm, but on booking, the owner was happy to agree that we could use the venue after this time. Our table reservation was for 8pm and we stayed until just after 10pm. The staff didn't rush us at all & we had an excellent time.\n\nThe food:\n\nThe burger night portions at Moo are very generous and we were full to the brim on leaving. The menu offers a choice of no-fuss starters (garlic bread, soup, onion rings, garlic mushrooms, coleslaw & salad) and a selection of five main course burger toppings that can be served with a beef, chicken or bean burger. All main courses are served with salad, coleslaw and a portion of seriously tasty hand-cut, homemade chips.\n\nI opted for a chicken burger, topped with bacon & Mull of Kintyre cheddar - it was absolutely delicious. The only disappointment was that the bread was rather ordinary. Tasty rolls from a local Edinburgh bakery would bump my rating up to 5 stars.\n\nThe service:\n\nThe owners and other staff at Moo are friendly, helpful and attentive. \n\nOriginally, I'd booked our table for 8.30pm, but moved our reservation to 8pm at quite short notice - the restaurant had no issue at all with this.\n\nThe Moo website had unfortunately been hacked and the burger menu was unavailable to download (issue now resolved), but within a few minutes of coming off the phone, the owner had emailed a copy to me, so that I could share it with friends.\n \nWe brought along a selection of prosecco, white wine & red wine (from the wonderful Cornelius on Easter Road) and as Moo charge no corkage fee this made a massive difference to the total bill; a very pocket-friendly \u00c2\u00a38 per head!\n\nFor hearty food on a budget, I highly recommend burger nights at Moo Cafeteria.\n\nMoo can be reached by bus on the #23, #27 and #8 routes and is well-placed for after dinner drinks in Canonmills, Broughton Street & Stockbridge."], "labels": [["Restaurants", "Food", "Coffee & Tea"]], "speaker_list": null}

The owners of this place own several places in town, some great and some ok, so they obviously could care less what I had to say.  It is about the food!  If you make great food then people will come.\n\nI am a sucker for trying every new place around, despite the countless bad reviews I read.  Cabo''s was the latest of the new places I've tried.  Was the food horrible?  No, the food was not horrible.  Was the restaurant dirty?  No, the restaurant was actually very clean and nicely decorated..  Was the service bad?  No, the service was ok.  \n\nIf nothing was horrible then why the two stars?  There are countless Mexican establishments in Champaign/Urbana and I've eaten at every one of them.  I would go eat at any of the good ones before going back here. The menu didn't contain 200 items like many of the other establishments, which I found kind of refreshing.  However, the prices were crazy high for Mexican food.  They charge $13.00 for a Fajita and $3.00 more if you want meat such as chicken or steak on it.  That is $16 for a Fajita that would be $9-$12 everywhere else.  \n\nThe food was not horrible, but it was bland.  The fajitas lacked flavor.  I had to salt and pepper it to make it taste like something.  When have you ever had to add salt and pepper to a Mexican dish after it has been served?  If the answer is more than zero then you've likely eaten at Cabo's or another bad Mexican restaurant. \n\nThe service consisted of countless college aged students of European decent.  I scanned the staff and didn't see one person that appeared to come from a Mexican background.   This is usually a worrisome sign for me at any ethnic restaurant, particularly at a Mexican restaurant.  This place could be Mexican-American owned and operated, but I doubt it.  The employees I encountered were pleasant, but the experience was nothing special.  Before you bash me as some white hating individual I must disclose that I'm white.  I also believe that my fellow fair skinned man can cook good ethnic food, but rarely is it ever as good as a person from that particular ethnic background (in this case Mexican). \n\nWith all the other Mexican establishments in town why would I eat here again?  I won't, I'll take my business and money elsewhere where I can get a better meal for less.

{"dialog_length": 1, "dialog_list": ["I was new to Toronto when I visited Local 4 a few months ago.  They were on my radar of places to check out due to a reputation for craft beers and good food that I'd heard through a friend -- and, when they popped up as a Groupon, I jumped.  The menu and beerlist on their website really sealed the deal.\n\nI invited a couple other friends who had never been to come along, one of whom is a picky eater (and, after looking at the site, was excited), the other of whom, like me, is always looking to try new beers.\n\nSo we get to Local 4...  and it's a huge let down.\n\nThe food was mediocre to bad.  \n\nI had the bison spaghetti bolognese, which tasted as though they forgot to salt the water when cooking the noodles.  The sauce was ok, but there was precious little of it.  When I order a pasta dish at a restaurant and it's $14, I expect it to be something more than I can prep, at home, with little effort.  I wouldn't have been ashamed to serve it myself, but I certainly wouldn't have expected any particular compliments after the fact.\n\nSteak & Frites went to one friend, who's experience was similar to others here:  steak was dry, tough, bad.\n\nOther friend had the chicken cordon bleu -- she finished the chicken, which was decent (but again, nothing special), then left the potatoes and vegetables as unpalatable.  I was incredulous, so tried a few...  and she was right.\n\nBut the kicker was the beer list or, more appropriately, the lack of one.  They didn't have a single one of the craft beers we specifically came to try -- we ended up ordering some Blanche de Chambley (a personal fave, but not one I was hoping to \"try\"), then stuck with cocktails.  They didn't have MacAuslan (either apricot or stout), Black Oak, or Stonehammer (dark or light).  Are you kidding me?  You're touting your craft beers, and your selections are mostly imports, Sleemans, and a cider?  And what you do have are the most common, usual suspects: Mill St, Steamwhistle, and the like?  \n\nWe were bummed.  Add to this that the server had a rather uncaring attitude, was slow, and, when presenting the bill, just dumped it on the table.  Even forgot to factor in the Groupon, and seemed annoyed that I wanted him to adjust it.  (Now I feel like I'm ragging on the guy -- he seemed like a cool guy, just kind of out of his depth.)\n\nIn any case, I would hesitate giving a 1* rating to Local 4 if only because there's great potential there:  nice ambience, cool location, a menu that looks good on paper...  but they need to seriously re-evaluate what they're doing and their approach to food, drink, and service.\n\nJudging by recent reviews, they're certainly not watching review sites for what people are saying, and that's too bad."], "labels": [["Restaurants", "American (New)"]], "speaker_list": null}

I made a sarcastic remark to my friends, thinking about how awesome I am, probably something along the lines of, \"This shit is a joke. Too easy.\" Well, like most really hot foods, these wings take awhile before they really hit you. When they do hit, have some fucking milk nearby. \n\nSooner or later I finished all of the wings.

They have that quiet pride that says, \"If you behave well, you're part of the family here.  If not, here's the door.\"  I didn't ask for anything special, but one suspects that if I asked them for, say, a pomegranate-infused soda, they'd look at me sternly and go, \"Now, what did you want THAT for?\"\n\nAs such, it's supremely pleasant atmosphere.  This is a classic DINER diner, a long narrow train tube with a row of stools for the quick eaters and beat-up booths in the back, where the scents waft out of the kitchen behind the counter.  \n\nThe food?  Well, as Gini notes, they put the greasy in greasy spoon, but that's actually part of the charm; they don't care about eating healthy, they want you to eat hearty.  They have all the greatest diner hits, from eggs and bacon to open-faced turkey sandwich, and the food is not exceptional but it is home-made and fills you up quite nicely on a low budget.\n\nWould I recommend this to my snooty foodie friends?

I only wished that CoffeeWorks had more than one flavored coffee available for the day.  I saw a wall of glass jars full of many, many flavors for coffee that they sell by the bag.  The coffee sizes were reasonably priced, too.  My only suggestions for them would be to (1) create a more relaxed seating area indoors other than basic tables and (2) switch to something besides the environment unfriendly styrofoam cups.  Otherwise, keep up the great work (and flavored coffees!); we'll be back!"], "labels": [["Food", "Coffee & Tea"]], "speaker_list": null}

Washington.  The wine selection is very good (as it should be) with probably 30-40 options by the glass with plenty under $10 options.

Now, the main reason this place is receiving a les than 3 star or \"A OK\" review is the food was not good at all.This is particularly disconcerning because what I ordered for us was relatively simple basic stuff.  I ordered the cheese plate, Pepper crusted seared tuna, and hummus.  The cheese plate was of decent quality, but served ice cold with no explanation of the variety.  It was also served with this ice cold stale bread and it could have benefited from a little charcuterie.  The hummus was also served with this tasteless tabouleh (I'd guess) and was again ice cold with a sour flavor to it and covered in some type of oil.  Finally, the tuna was for me inedible.

My gf and I went in for the first workout and were impressed. Brian and his wife Katie were extremely friendly and professional. There were no high-pressure sales tactics to sign up for anything, just sign the waiver and start working out! After the workout we decided on the 3 day per week membership but soon transitioned to full-time as we were both seeing great gains from the training and made many friends in the gym. We usually go to the 7pm class during the week because it fits our work schedule, and the Saturday morning class. They have early morning classes also for those that go before work.\n\nTwo years later and joining Crossfit Magna is one of the best decisions we have ever made. We actually look forward to going to the gym in the evening after work. I can't say that about my previous training regimens. With Crossfit you have to be careful about the gym you pick as they are definitely NOT all the same. Some coaches are great, some not so great.

If you stand in front of their seat to order a drink from the bar (because they went to go dance or something) they will let you know that you may NOT continue to stand there, even for a second.  The bartenders at both places are sweet and quick about their service.\n\nTHE DRINKS:\nWeak at both places, but IIRC, they are cheaper at Chez.  The no-card policy at Chez is a nuisance, so Char's is preferable here.  They both serve the typical booze and beer, so nothing really stands out other than the cost (Chez cheaper) and the convenience (Char's takes card).\n\nTHE MUSIC:\nThey are both MANIACALLY cool spots for some soul-funk-blues and great dance floors to boot.  This is the main reason to but up with any inconveniences, small or large, at either place.  \n\nTHE SET-UP:\nJust packed at both places.   If you want to come at a decent hour, you won't get a seat.  So, just forget about it.  Both buildings are pretty neat setups.  Chez is more of a railroad-style-room, and Chars more of a dance-hall set up.  Both have smoking patios, though Char's is small and quaint with tables and a busy atmosphere, while Chez's is (assuming) not complete and barren but large.  \n\nOVERALL:\nChar's Has the Blues AND the lead over Chez due to the fact that I can't seem to get over the vibe that I don't belong to \"The Secret Club\" ...shhhhh ... over at Chez.

I am stretched very thin some days and em always standing over all of them like a stalker lol. I'm what they call a helicopter parent lol. And I get so nervous when I have that many kids. How on earth am I going to keep eyes on some many at once all by my self? So when I come to Garside I am not so overwhelmed knowing that I have lifeguards right next to me that care just as much as I do for my kids safety. They rotate positions in a circle every 15 mins. So no lifeguard gets tunnel vision. They are constantly alert. It's a wonderful idea to make sure everyone is fresh on their feet. So for all these lifeguards do to keep our children safe...

I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly, but the flavorings are all just powders and artificial. The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make! I much prefer real fruit to powdered mixes, but to each his own.\n\n*Service is exponentially better. The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink. My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly\n\n*Atmosphere. I love the sexy lounge/patio they have going! Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise. \n\n--------------------------\n\nI've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here. The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis. I do have to give the edge to Firefly on the sangria, however. They only have one kind at Cana and it's just oK.\n\nWe've tried half the menu and love nearly everything we've tried. I think the low point is sadly  the ceviche. We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style. If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs. It was sloppy and uninspired imo.\n\nOn the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas. They aren't traditional, but wow the puff pastry dough is good. The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders. The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot. I think our favorite was the short rib. A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce. \n\nIf you're a Firefly regular - give it a try. It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better!

First of all, for the price of the appetizers, we were expecting A LOT more than a small plate of fries and a ramekin of dip. The \"crostini\" that came with the dip was inedible...literally. They were burnt and rock hard that they were impossible to bite into. I asked for some pita bread instead which was softer, but had been \"grilled\" which gave it a burnt taste - likely the result of a grill that is not cleaned very often. The sweet potato fries were slightly undercooked and were served with a watery chipotle mayo (great flavour, but thin consistency.)\n\nFor entrees I ordered the falafel which is touted on the menu as being the \"best in the city\" and for $13, I had pretty high expectations.

The front desk does take reservations so I figured since it was a Friday night I would go ahead and make one.  Upon arriving the restaurant was not busy at all, so reservations were not necessary but it's a good option to have just in case.  We were seated immediately.  The hostess tried to give us a table with chairs and I asked if we could have one of those big white comfy-looking booths instead so she obliged.  Within 3 minutes someone arrived with water and hot bread and butter.  As we were looking at the menu and perusing the wine list, the waiter appeared and helped us with our drink order.  They did not have the wine I selected off the wine list, so I opted for the house Cabernet...which was really good!\n\nThe bread and butter were a perfect start.  The bread was delicious and the butter was whipped and soft, not that butter in the gold packets that  is cold.  Once I had that, I knew that the rest of the dinner was going to be great.  I ordered the garlic roasted chicken, which comes on whipped garlic potatoes with an au jus gravy and cippolini onions.  YUM...It was sooooo tasty. I loved every minute of it. Great flavor and perfect sized portions.  The dinner also came with a choice of soup or salad.  For the soup they had Manhattan style clam chowder.  It was good but I think I still prefer the New England style.  The salad had big chunks of bacon with blue cheese crumbles.  Comes with a vinaigrette but I opted for ranch instead.  I was very satisfied with the quality of food. Part of me worried that the food may still be \"casino style\"....but it really was nothing like that.  I actually thought it was better than some of the steak houses around Chandler that aren't in casinos. Pricing was a bit above average...but $42 for everything still wasn't that bad, and that included the wine. \n\nService was great...it did seem to take longer than normal to get our entree, but the wine and the bread, soup and salad kept us busy and allowed for conversation between plates.  I had read all the reviews here before I even went to this restaurant, but I'm glad I didn't listen to the bad reviews and not go. I will definitely go back again.

It was Internet that required purchases at specifically timed intervals.\n\nWhere those not using wi-fi were able to \"sit there for hours and talk without being interrupted or otherwise bothered,\" Internet users at Caribou didn't have that pleasure.  Sure, they might get up and purchase a $1.50 worth of Caribou products every 1.5 hours, but there was nobody holding them to that.  I'm guessing if somebody interrupted one of their discussions to ask them to purchase something, they would have found it to be a little odd, a little rude, and a little uncalled for.\n\nIn other words, we're all big enough to make those purchases on our own.  We don't need a timer running by our side.  Thus, there should be no separation between Internet-users and those just whiling away the hours in discussion.  \n\nSecondly, the 1.5 hours system never really worked.  At each Caribou, the workers would just hand you a stack of tickets with the codes.  They all seemed to find the mandatory purchase thing to be silly, and acted accordingly.

Allerdings nicht hier, sondern an Englands S\u00c3\u00bcdk\u00c3\u00bcste. Die Landschaft war wundersch\u00c3\u00b6n und Palmen h\u00c3\u00a4tte ich dort nicht vermutet. Das Essen war das krasse Gegenteil... \n\nEnglische Kochkunst ist im Allgemeinen wirklich keine sehr ruhmvolle Angelegenheit und zu allem \u00c3\u009cbel war die Gastmutter eine grauenhafte K\u00c3\u00b6chin.

Letzten Montag habe ich es getan... und sogar freiwillig! Die Zeit heilt bekanntlich viele Wunden und so blieb im Hirn zwar der dezente Grusel zu Pfefferminzsauce und Salad Cream erhalten, aber es kamen auch positive Erinnerungen zutage. Scones zum Beispiel - wahlweise mit Rosinen und gesalzener Butter, oder \"Normale\" Scones mit Clotted Cream und Erdbeermarmelade...

They have a number of local discounts and group package options. They also let you take photos throughout the class which may or may not be a good thing (especially bad if you're planning to use the photos for blackmail). \n\nIf you're comfortable with them, wear heels. It's more fun that way. Because you need to stick to the pole better, don't wear any lotion if you can help it and try to wear short shorts so you can get more skin on the pole (sounds weird but it helps keep you up on the pole). \n\nI will definitely be back since they do a lot of class specials and the price is pretty great for girls who've never done this kind of class and want to try out something fun!"], "labels": [["Nightlife"]], "speaker_list": null}

The service was perfect, but a little odd in a good way.  We expected a refined and polished server with a side of arrogance, typical for a joint like this and what we got was a \"motherly\" type woman who was not only attentive and knowledgeable but also caring and went out of her way to make us comfortable with a bit of a dry sense of humor.  What a nice change of pace! \n\nSecond trip demonstrated that the first wasn't a fluke.  I opted for the Veal Chop and my wife the Filet.  This time the Filet was unimpressive and a little smallish and perhaps overdone, but the Veal Chop was outstanding.  It was huge and so well-prepared that I had a hard time feeling sorry for my wife's sub-standard cut of beef.  Thankfully it was big enough for us to share and we both left satisfied.  The service was again fantastic and we were taken care of by another woman who valued delivering real service and comfort over playing the stereotypical server role.  This trip we noticed the doors to the beautiful outdoor patio were open and a band of some sort was getting ready to play.  \n\nSidenote: We originally chose the Chophouse because Shula's at another casino just a few miles away was booked.  It is really hard for us to find value in Shula's after dining at Verona Chophouse.  Sure Shula's can be great, but by my estimation, you will pay about 30-40% more there and you could still get an average meal and crappy service  AND there is no way in hell Shula's could make a Veal Chop as good as Verona."], "labels": [["American (New)", "Restaurants"]], "speaker_list": null}

However, things have taken a turn for the worst in 2014 by the company, as evidenced by the other reviews on this site.  Even from the get go, I had difficulty receiving an email with the contract.  Jennifer, the owner, attributed the delay the first time to problems with the email: info@museartistrylv.com.  Eventually, we sorted that out.  Email problems happen, so I figure no big deal.

My trial time is 11am...I just happen to check my email while waiting for them to show up for the trial.  In my inbox is an email, sent that morning, canceling for the day since one of the artists is ill. Okay, illness happens but as a professional company and owner you need to pick up the phone and call your client. An email is not an acceptable form of cancellation. So I pick up my phone and call to see if I can reschedule, no answer on her personal cell or the company phone number.  The best part is the voicemail that states leave your info and we will get back to you in 24 hours.  I also email both emails again asking for someone to call me regarding rescheduling.  Yeah...don't count on a response in 24 hours. Fast forward 4 days later, I again send another email and leave voicemails on both numbers requesting contact.  I decide at this point to send a text message with something along the lines of please let me know if I need to start looking elsewhere for hair and makeup services.  I finally get a text message stating that her phone had died and that she would make my next appointment a priority.  Okay, I get your phone died but you clearly still have access to email since you sent me one to cancel the morning of the trial.... I follow up by asking who the artists will be for the trial, it ended up not being the same two listed on my contract.

Before an annual holiday trip to Vegas, I stumbled across this activity as something I could redeem my Chase credit card points for, so I went ahead and did it and I'm glad I did! My girlfriend and I like going to Vegas every year but this was just what we needed to keep it interesting.\n\nThe hour-long bus rides to and from Pahrump were comfortable and informative, with Mikko being our guide and doing an excellent job. The blind tastings on the bus were fun even if I didn't do so well! The wineries were nice and the people that worked there and gave out tours were amazing! I learned A LOT about how wine is made in general and in a place like the Nevada desert at the first winery, Pahrump Valley Winery. The folks doing the tastings were also very pleasant, especially Jack, the owner of the second winery, Sanders Family Winery -- he was hilarious, very knowledgeable and just great to listen to. He makes you feel like you're family and just having a glass of wine with a friend.\n\nAs for the wines...well, wine is a matter of taste and I'm pretty much like Thomas Haden Church's character in Sideways where I think it all tastes the same, but there was one wine (Burgundy) at Sanders Family Winery that I really enjoyed to the point I bought a bottle, not something I usually do while wine tasting (typically the tastings themselves satisfy my wine craving for months). I've always been more into wine tasting for the experience and beauty of the vineyards, and the two wineries met that requirement as well. Finally, the lunch at Symphony's was VERY good. I had the grilled chicken panini with steak fries and it hit the spot, especially after all the tasting. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that there is A LOT of wine included in this. Two lengthy tastings at two wineries (plus tasting any other wine you want after lunch at Pahrump Valley Winery) and the blind tastings on the bus was quite a bit...I won't say too much because I did, after all, sign up for wine tasting, but it came to the point by the end of the day I was sure I didn't want to drink wine again for a loooonnnnggg time. It didn't help that the second winery, Sanders Family Winery, didn't have any crackers or anything of the sort to go with the wine (I recommend you bring some), but it was only a minor scratch on an otherwise great experience I highly recommend!"], "labels": [["Food", "Arts & Entertainment"]], "speaker_list": null}

The focus is on a \"zen relaxed\" atmosphere, with brick oven pizza and nuances of Asian cuisine (mostly the sides) peppering the menu. \n\nAtmosphere/Ambiance A - It's trendy casual. Interior is Asian themed with splashes of Asian art on the walls and ceiling. (Love the dragon painted beam) The dining area is small 5 tables of two on each side. You can easily rearrange seating for 2 or more. The middle there's a longer high top table for larger parties. There is also seating in the small bar area at back of restaurant. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed, Easy Rock tunes (Brown Eyed Girl) was playing in the background.  No TV's though. Still it's a nice place for lunch or stop by after work and chill in the small bar area kind of joint.\n  \nFood B++ -  Now take into account I'm not a big fan of pizza lately. If you ever notice my pix at pizza places I dine at, I order everything but pizza most of the time...lol. But  for first visit sake I had some here.  All the pizzas are themed with Asian names, but toppings are just your average pizza toppings. I had the Ho-Tai(The Happy Buddha)  which was artichoke hearts, spinach, cherry tomatoes, garlic and olive oil. The crust was baked perfect, NY style, not super thin crust though. The ingredients fresh and good quality. The sauce was evenly distributed on pizza. It didn't overpower the cheese and veggies. I enjoyed the pizza.  It made me happy. \n   \nI also had the chicken salad. Thin strips of tender white chicken and napa cabbage,and rice noodles, the vinaigrette used was perfect for me, just slightly sweet and not too tangy and evenly tossed in the salad. I will most likely come here just to have this salad for lunch next time.  Along with the Japanese pretzel sticks.  Those were different. Tiny pretzel sticks with garlic infused chili oil to dip. \n \nPrices are in the moderate range, I didn't see any lunch hour or happy hour specials.\n  \nService A+ - Friendly and efficient. For being open just a few days, service far out exceeded my expectations.  My server was knowledgeable about menu items and was able to answer my questions. The owner Mark also came by and followed up and chatted with me. He takes great pride and rightfully so with his new place.  Loves everything about Hawaii and the shave ice served here is inspired by Matsumoto's.  It's not quite like shave ice from the 808, but nice attempt with the Azuki (sweet red beans) and vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe other fun touches....The Wish Book! When you are presented with your check at the end, you get a Smartie candy and a little booklet where you get to write your wish and insert it in the wish keeper that's displayed in the middle of dining area.

Anyway....Their Sunday brunch is excellent, with made to order pasta and omelets, as well as pancakes, french toast, fresh fruit, several different salads, panko crusted grouper and a few other various pork and beef choices.  There is more than what I listed but my only complaint is that I feel there could still be a few more options for the $18.95 per person price.  For example, while I don't generally eat prime rib for brunch its a popular option that was not available here.  What I want to take the time to point out is all the ingredients in the salads, omelets, pasta and the fruit looked and tasted extremely fresh.  The omelet, the french toast and the grouper were probably my three favorite items.  The french toast has a cinnamon flavor with maybe a slight brown sugar crunch, it was not at all soggy and the topping choices of fresh berries, whipped cream, butter or warm ginger maple syrup were excellent.  Some of the best french toast I can remember to be honest.  The Panko crusted grouper was nice and light but still crispy and the grouper was not at all fishy, very fresh.   The omelet was huge, took up half the plate, but it was excellent as well, probably ranks near the tops for any buffet I can remember.  The only other knock is that beverages were not included at that price either.

Being so close, I had to check it out.\n\nThe menu is deceptive. It doesn't look very vegetarian, but it turns out they are willing to vegetarianize just about everything on the menu, are conscious about dietary problems and don't use shrimp paste! Yay!\n\nI booked for 7.30 today. Before 8pm from Monday-Thursday there is a pre-theatre menu, where you get a starter and a main for \u00c2\u00a312.99. Upon entering we noticed  that the place was pretty empty, there was just one other couple eating. We put this down to the out of the way location, but after half an hour it suddenly filled up! The interior is minimalist and tastefully decorated, nothing too intrusive. The waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered from the pre-theatre menu: spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce, pad thai with tofu. I ordered a green curry with tofu and thai sticky rice. My boyfriend Robbie thought his starter was a bit small, but very much enjoyed it and his main made up for the small starter size. His pad thai came with the peanuts and various spices on the side (to sprinkle over the noodles), and a small salad. He said it was delicious, but after tasting some of mine he looked jealously at my dish every so often. Mine was super spicy, with plenty of red chillies in the sauce, fragrant herbs and spices, big chunks of fried tofu and plenty of fresh crunchy vegetables. My rice came in a bamboo bag which was used to steam it. The portion size was massive, but it was so good that I ate more or less everything. \n\nThai puddings are amongst my favourites. Robbie opted for the banana fritter with coconut ice cream, whilst I went for the banana cooked in sweet coconut milk. Strangely enough, this is a quite nostalgic dish for me as I used to eat it a lot when I went out for dinner with my grandparents. It is relatively healthy in comparison to other dessert options, and really rather delicious. The presentation of both pudding was really beautiful, and Robbie wolfed his pudding down despite having declared he was stuffed a few seconds before. He added that it was the best part of the meal... \n\nFor \u00c2\u00a330 for two without drinks, it wasn't that expensive. I am not sure why Thai is always pricier than other places, but Celadon is cheaper than most but definitely superior to most. Fresh ingredients are well cooked, service is, as Emily H stated, \"flawless\". I would definitely come back here to sample some of the other dishes on offer."], "labels": [["Restaurants"]], "speaker_list": null}

But being the only choice for Thai food in the area, you don't really have a choice. After my first visit, I don't think this place is all bad.

I arrived about 10 minutes after I placed the call and the food was ready and packaged and sitting on the counter. We took the food home to eat and it pretty much confirmed my suspicions on authenticity. I'll comment on each item.\n\nRed Curry: Best dish of the night and tastes authentic. The dish is loaded with flavor and chicken pieces.\n\nPhad thai chicken: I've had phad thai at many places and there seems to be a wide range of difference. PP's phad thai feels like Chinese stir-fry to me. It seems to be missing some key Thai ingredients. Too light on the fish sauce, not enough eggs, and I think they used onions instead of shallots. \n\nBasil Beef: I don't feel the basil. It kind of tastes like regular Chinese stir-fry beef with veggies with an added spiciness. Compared with the red curry, the there's a lot less meat in this dish. Not bad, but doesn't feel Thai enough.\n\nTamarind Shrimp: I never want to eat this dish again. This is not tamarind. This tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce, and not a very well made one.\n\nTheir prices aren't cheap, but not outrageously expensive either. The portion size is generous. I would come again, but I'm definitely going to stick with the curries. I suspect this place uses powders for some dishes. I don't see how they could have prepped my meal so quickly otherwise.

When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full.

We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress. After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon... We were starving! Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food. \n\nThe first dish to arrive was mini chorizo corn dogs. Flavor was terrible, no spice at all. The texture was even worse. Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche. Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab. \n\nFinally our 3rd dish arrived, the hirame ceviche.

The wall of windows lights the place up awesomely, and even at night, it doesn't turn into one of those dark, moody coffee joints. They find new artists to show art every couple of months or so, and it's usually pretty good. Their couple handfuls of small tables are easy to shift around if you're joining a group, but big groups might feel uncomfortable since it's not exactly huge. There's a nice quiet room around the back for people studying, but it's not enclosed, so on open mic nights or nights when there are featured performers, it's not so quiet. I love how clean they keep the place; when the baristas aren't working the counter, they're wiping down the windows, bussing tables, and restocking the coffee condiment bar. \n\nSpeaking of the baristas, they're always friendly and attentive, good at showing off how to hustle (because when a coffee shop's busy, I feel better if baristas actually act like it), and totally interesting to look at--like fashion icons for today's college-aged generation, some with interesting piercings and tattoos, fashionable and stylish by not trendy clothes--seems like there's an appreciation for staff who are unique, interesting, and good workers. It's never uncomfortable, though--meaning, I never feel too old or unhip or out of place there. Customers truly run the gamut, from quiet middle-aged women catching up with each other, moms and/or dads with kids, suit-and-tie professionals stopping in for a cuppa, people hitting the wi-fi, and angsty artsy types having heated but civil political debates. \n\nI usually have the chai tea latte, but their coffee is always solid (I can attest to a decent caf\u00c3\u00a9 mocha), and I hear a lot of praise about their daily specials--every day, a different bean, special coffee, and iced tea. Prices are a little cheaper than Starbucks (I think it was $2.50 for the tasty mango lemon iced tea, and the larger specialty coffees can go up to $4.50), but the drinks are better. Pastries are always tasty and include a small selection of rugalah (buttery, flaky, chocolatey goodness--also available with raspberry or apple), a bigger selection of muffins, big and puffy croissants, bagels, cookies, brownies, rice krispie treats--certainly not a fully stocked French patisserie, but what they have is usually really good quality.

The space was nice and open - this place would do well for those looking to study. I couldn't help but notice however the modern chicness of it all, which did come across as semi-contrived. But whatever, it still gave good energy. \n\nThe menu looked interesting and expansive. There were a few choices on there I haven't seen before, such as a coconut cold brew, or a hazelnut milk latte. After some questions about the various drinks, bean sources, etc, I opted to go for the hazelnut milk latte with white chocolate added. My girl had a Brazilian hot pour coffee coffee with hazlenut milk on the side. Tempted by the tasty looking pastries, we also decided to get a peach pie. It was a pie and coffee kind of day.\n\nWe noticed immediately that there was something off about the hazelnut milk. I was expecting something silky and slightly creamy, like good almondmilk can be. What we got tasted like wet chalk. Nasty. I had them remake my girl's coffee, and I stuck with mine. I wasn't content at all, but didn't want the hassle of them remaking two drinks. So hers came back, this time with steamed milk; but still, the coffee just wasn't good. I'm sorry - it wasn't. She and I both agreed that it tasted little better than Folger's. There was no depth, no fruit or chocolate notes, nothing. And this coming from a pour over! I can't imagine what a drip brew would taste like. \n\nMy latte, aside from the persistent chalk texture, also had no flavor. The white chocolate was non-existent. The espresso, barely distinguishable at all. It really didn't even taste like there was any in there. I've tried nearly every coffee place's latte in the Tempe and Scottsdale area, so I have a fair idea of what is good and what is not. Again, very disappointing, especially since the menu looked so promising. And the kicker to all this is the peach pie had no flavor, no life, nothing. It tasted like a frozen pie that had been defrosted and was sitting out for hours. This supposedly being a made from scratch pastry! Oh, and the barista forgot to even bring it to us, immediately after we ordered it. We had to remind her. \n\nThe people were fairly nice, and the space was inviting, which saves this place from being a one star in my book. But I know we will certainly not be back.

We stopped in for a pastry and coffee to follow up lunch at Cuba Cafe. \n\nConfession: We had a full meal with appetizers, sides, entrees, dessert, AND coffee at Cuba Cafe but, upon realizing Roly's was just down the street and on the way home, we decided to turn our cheat meal into a cheat life. I'm not ashamed. \n\nThough I was unable to eat again until the next day, I'm both glad we visited and sad we didn't know about this place sooner. \n\nMy husband and I are recent transplants from LA where Cuban bakeries are abundant (Porto's and Cafe Tropical being two popular go-to's). I mention this because most of my experience with Roly's is best explained through comparisons from what I already know.\n\nWe ordered a guava cheese pastry, otherwise known as a pastel de guayaba con queso, and two espressos. \n\nThe coffee: It's very easy to percolate a pot of Cuban coffee at home but it's so refreshing to have it done for you on a much cooler industrial percolator.  Based on the cups used, Gavina is the grounds of choice here. Within minutes, two steaming cups were brought to our table and we were directed to the counter for our sweeteners. My Cuban husband was disappointed to not have his coffee made with the characteristic sugar slurry but, at the same time, having the option of using non-sugar sweetener was nice (sidenote: on our second visit today, we were asked if we wanted sugar already mixed in, which my husband enthusiastically accepted).\n\nThe pastry: We were served a pastry that was still warm and crusty. It was absolutely delicious. Here's where the comparison comes in: while the price point is higher at just a bit over $1 per pastry, it was more than generously filled with guava paste and cream cheese. The ratio was just about perfect, which I cannot often say about the pastries at Porto's. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=ZfpGGDu42EwzKPPkAnDyNA#ZfpGGDu42EwzKPPkAnDyNA\n\nA quick scan of the cases and menu showed two things: cuban crackers and bread that we'd been missing all this time as well as breakfast served all day.

All come with a pastry and coffee. \n\nI ordered the #1 with fried eggs and added bacon. Now, at $1 extra for the bacon, I expected one or two small slices. What I got was THREE crispy thick slices. The eggs were fried perfectly to my liking. The toast? Well, what's there to complain about when you're given freshly buttered toasted Cuban bread?\n\nMy husband ordered the #3 with scrambled eggs and a guava pastry. First, it's clear the eggs used are real and not bagged. Second, my husband was thrilled to find that they're seasoned lightly with Sazon, a popular Latin seasoning blend that we use in his eggs at home. Now, the most important part. My husband loves croquettes but has learned not to expect much from any place that sells them. Today, that changed. He bit into his croquette expecting the usual mediocrity and, instead, his eyes lit up and he looked toward the kitchen said, \"Oh my god, MOM? ARE YOU IN THERE?\". I took a bite and can attest to the fact that these are the best croquettes I've had from an eatery. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=XPrpcXPwngzgMdZljGUU0g#XPrpcXPwngzgMdZljGUU0g\n\nAll in all, breakfast came to about $13 before tip.

{"dialog_length": 1, "dialog_list": ["What a terrible shopping experience I had there today.  Friends had bought my wife and I a wedding gift, a gift card from Williams-Sonoma.  Firstly the web site wouldn't allow us to redeem it (even though they say all over the site that you can, apparently it only applies to US shoppers and not Canadians).  So into the store I trekked with my list of 3 things that I couldn't buy from the site with the gift card.  Sounds simple enough, right? \n\nOn arrival I was asked if I needed help, and I said yes and informed the sales woman that I had a list of specific items that I was looking for and that it even had the item numbers/SKUs.  She sounded very surprised but didn't want the list I had printed that though would make life much easier, she wanted the items by name ... but only one at a time.  Sooooo it all started.  After 20+ minutes of waiting around and them fumbling through their inventory software they \"found\" the first item I was looking for in the back ... the computer told them they had 4 in stock but they were all scratching their heads as to where they would be.   The sales woman brought me 3 of the 4 of them they had, apparently so I could \"look\" at the different ones and decide which I wanted (this was a boxed up pair of knives in a gift set).  I thought it a bit strange but picked up the first box, opened it up and said \"Yes, this is what I want.\"\n\nAfter scanning in this first item the price was a good bit more than it was on the website.  I asked about this and was told in a very brusk manner by the store manager (who had taken over at this point, apparently it was too much for the other employee to handle) that there was no way they could \"match\" the price advertised on their website, and that the price that I had on my list must be in US dollars.  It was not.  It took her about 10 minutes of clicking all around the website to concede that the price I showed her was indeed in Canadian dollars.\n\nShe then proceeded to tell me that she still couldn't match the price because \"of course you still have to pay duty on that price\" ... and the answer was no, you do not, all the prices they show on the site include all applicable duty (this is in bold in 18 point font at the top of the page which was currently open on her computer and I pointed this out to her).  Then she proceeds to tell me \"Oh look, see this?  There's a flat rate $10 shipping charge on any items so I still can't price match that price because you have to pay shipping\" ... I proceeded to ask her \"So you're telling me that I have to pay a $10 shipping fee even though I'm here in the store to pick the item up?!??\" ...\n\nThe arguing went along for a few more minutes with her giving me even more excuses why she couldn't possibly match the price on the website until I pulled out my phone and actually read her the statement on the website that stated that all advertised prices were valid in any Williams-Sonoma retail store.  She still wasn't budging, so I asked to speak to her supervisor.  When she told me that she was the store manager and didn't have a supervisor, so I then asked her to call up her head office and have THEM explain to ME why I had been standing here wasting time for over half of an hour and that it was ok for her to charge me more than the advertised price for the item in question.  She finally relented and insisted on looking at the US price for the item and then using today's exchange rate in order to \"fix\" the price on my item -- so it turned out to be $0.61 more expensive than the website price.  Luckily while all of this waiting around was happening I found the other couple of items that were on my list by myself and they didn't need price adjustments.\n\nAll-in-all one of the worst shopping experiences I've had in a long, long time.  I will likely never set foot in that store again.

If I'm being honest, my review is more of a 3.5.  They open at 11:00 and we got there around 11:05.  We were about 5th in line to get in.  One drawback was standing in line next to the Fairy's Mist or Bounty or some shit slot machine while Ol Lady Wild Turkey smokes her Kool 100s and waves them around and cackles about the good deals she got in Laughlin.  Good Lord....\n\nWe were seated right on time.  The selections on the buffet were nice.  Some stand-outs were the prime rib, scalloped potatoes, bacon, and scrambled eggs.  I didn't go near the salad section, but it looked good and fresh from where I stood getting my plate full of bacon and eggs.  For $30 apiece I didn't think it was too bad of a value, but a cheap mimosa thrown in would have been nice.  The only thing that wasn't good on the buffet was the cubed sweet potatoes.  They were only about half cooked and had NO flavor.  A chef-type person kept walking around surveying the scene and I can't believe those sweet potatoes were put out.  Not good at all.  \n\nWe also didn't use the omelet station, but we sat very close to it and it appeared that the young woman cooking was very friendly and fast and the omelets looked good.

They had mini cannolis and then some small tartlets with what tasted like a peanut butter mousse.  Delicious!  \n\nTheir patio area is so lovely and next time I want to be sure to sit out there if weather permits.  Our server was very attentive and friendly too.  There was one snafu I think with some of the staff trying to light one of those heaters outside or something because suddenly there was some screaming and I wondered if I needed to grab my knife and hit the deck, but it was something to do with the heater I think.

With a communal indifference to the dinner option after our blunder, we agreed. The warning sign should have been how empty the restaurant was with a single patron sitting at the back of the restaurant working vigilantly on her computer and nursing a beer.  The lone waitress didn't greet us, didn't nod an acknowledgment and didn't seem to give a rat's that we were there. Despite this, after deciding on a table, we sat ourselves down and patiently waited for the lone ranger to wander over. 10 minutes later, she strolled over and handed us three menus with a half assed greeting. \n\nNow, it's a no brainer: you come to a chicken wing place, you get something chicken related. However, I'm weird about touching my food and without fail, will always vote for the boneless option. So, you can imagine the gut sinking feeling when the waitress reappeared 15 minutes later and she advised they were out of the boneless option. \n(Why it would take 15 minutes to flip through the three page menu, [one of which consists of wing flavours to decide] in order for you to draw the conclusion that A: You want chicken. B: You want it in some variety, or C: You like to play on the wild side (see what I did there?) and stray away from the traditional by getting a burger.) (You daredevil, you.)  \n\nFine: I will meet your lack of boneless option and go with the chicken fingers. \n\nI should have taken the no boneless option as my third warning to run while I still I had a chance. \n\nUpon the waitresses arrival, we were greeted by plastic plates (why on earth any establishment would be serving their meals on plastic plates purchased at their local Dollarama is absolutely BEYOND ME) and quite possibly the soggiest, stalest tasting nachos. The salsa tasted rancid, and the lettuce was wilted. Upon the arrival of my entree I encountered what appeared to look like it had come straight out of a Hungry Man frozen dinner... the chicken fingers smelled off... like they'd been sitting in the back of the fridge. I was feeling ballsy, so I took a bite... I wasn't convinced. My boyfriend's GarPar chicken wings followed suit, and they were bland tasting.\n\n20 minutes later when our waitress arrived to do a very delayed quality control check, she asked how everything was tasting. I explained to her the lack lustre experience I was having with my meal, she stared at me blankly as she asked me several times to describe how they tasted...they tasted freezer burned...they tasted off...how many other ways did I need to find in order to describe this? \"Do you want another meal made?\" No, I want to get out of here as quickly as possible...instead I asked for some more sour cream...I should have anticipated that upon her return, the sour cream would be extremely watery and very off in texture. An elderly couple helplessly attempted to flag down our waitress whom she ignored several times before the poor woman with an evident bad hip hobbled over to her requesting her attention. Given the destitute of people within the restaurant, it was easy enough to hear the woman explain that her chicken...well...it didn't taste like chicken. The waitress feigned surprise before asking: \"Does it taste like freezer burn?\" \"Yes!\"\n\nFACE PALM. \n\nWhen my boyfriend went up to settle the bill, he was started to find my meal on the bill.

She did not have the check ready plus I had to rummage throughout her store to find my items myself. At the last minute she told me that I had sold 1 more item but she couldn't add that amount to this payment. Noooo! I'd have to come back next month while she smilingly added, \"Oh, but the good news is, you won't have to make an appointment since it's just a couple of dollars & I'll give you cash.\" The next saga began as every time I stopped in it was closed, as in Charisse could not get to her own store on time. Finally, she was there. I asked for my money but she said she couldn't give it to me since her computer was down. I assured her that the amount was correct, even offering to fax the required paperwork when I came home. That wasn't good enough for her. She couldn't possibly trust me because then anyone could walk-in from the street & demand money. I tried to use the rationale that I've had to trust her when she sold my clothes. But what was I thinking? She's is bereft of acumen. Her next deceptive maneuver was: No appointment, No money.  I told her that I'm tired of coming to her store & just wanted my money. She then arrogantly sneered, \"So you won't be able to pay your rent if I don't give the money to you?\" That was a new low even for her. I repeated my request over & over until she finally slammed the money on the counter. I was not going to allow her to keep one more red cent of mine. It was the principle. She owed me the money.

I had a pretty good Big Smoke Burger experience on King West. I was hoping that this closer-to-home Big Smoke location would at least be good, but it was not. Unfortunately I'm not going to have my Big Smoke cravings satisfied without having to drive to Toronto. \n\nSo I order the spicy burger combo and I watch the dude slap my patty on the grill. So far so good. I then watch the grill continuously flare up. I really had to restrain myself from being a back-seat griller and shouting out, \"Hey, buddy, how about you try controlling those flare ups, please.\" I didn't want to be one of those people so I said nothing. \n\nI also said nothing as I continued to watch my patty shrink ever so quickly because of all the flare ups. I continued to say nothing as the dude flipped my patty over and over again when what I really wanted to do was yell at the top of my lungs, \"Dude, that patty must be done by now with all the direct fire it's received. Pull it now!\" \n\nJust as the dude is about to pull my patty off the grill, the other guy says, \"It's a spicy,\" so the first guy puts my surely overcooked patty back on the grill and covers it with grilled onions to warm up the onions. They left that overcooked patty with the onions on the grill for another three minutes or so as my burger loving soul died a little more. Finally he pulled the patty.\n\nWhat did I end up with? A creosote covered charcoal briquette. Black on the outside, dry as MDF on the inside. I knew this was happening. I knew this was happening and I said nothing because I assumed people who are paid to cook burgers everyday know more than I and because I didn't want to be one of those people. This is what happens when you restrain yourself because you don't want to be one of those people. You end up with a dangerously  blackened (seriously dangerous, read the studies about blackened grill meats)  burger and a little of your soul dying as a good burger goes up in flames (literally!). I would have brought it back, but I was in a big rush and I didn't have time to watch them ruin another patty. \n\nThe Big Smoke head office people need to get on this situation and do some remedial training for this crew. This is unacceptable. You can't serve people blackened, dried out patties. It doesn't taste pleasant and it's not safe to eat."], "labels": [["Restaurants"]], "speaker_list": null}

I would assume since it's and Asian festival that there would be Asian type stuff to buy but most of the booths were consultation type ones or were births that were trying to get you to buy a service or a timeshare. I guess that's kinda Asian lol..\n\nThere were no cultural booths to educate anyone on what they are celebrating just quick tid-bits of cultural dancing followed by a major dose of hip-hop. \n\nThe food booths were comprised of many local Vegas restaurants and food trucks. Many f the food booths (mostly Thai and satay booth)were downright disgusting nearly all of them had skewered food sitting out for God knows how long waiting for some sucker to buy them.. We steered far away from those. On top of many of the food booths charged an arm and a leg for their food. I know that is to be expected  at an event but when it's $2.00 more than their restaurant menu price and combined with a smaller portion makes for a craptastic experience. \nIn addition why is McDonald's there? The only thing Asian about McDonald's is that we all used to work there? \n\nOne big minus for me was the lack of SnowOno shave ice. The shaved ice booth on location was Bleh! I could have done a better job with my snoopy shave ice maker at home!\n\nThe only saving grace on the food was they brought in a few out of town trucks like fluffy ice. \nWe spent $60+ there and still left hungry. \n\nThere was an abundance of rental carnival rides and carnival related food booths.

We had never been, so when we arrived at 7:00 we thought the doors would be open to serve food, but when they say doors open and 7:30, they open at 7:30. As we were waiting outside, 7:30 rolled around and we were told the doors would be opening at 7:45 instead. Okay, fine, we were hungry but we could wait. 7:45, doors didn't open. 8:00, doors didn't open. Finally around 8:15, 15 minutes after the show was suppose to start we got in and we grabbed one of the first tables we saw, right at the front near the stage. \n\nWe sat down and were handed menus pretty quickly. A waitress came around and asked if we'd been helped, we said no and ordered a Coke (which was 90% ice) and PBR. We then mentioned that we'd be ordering food tonight. Then about a minute later another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped, we said yes and assumed they a communication or organizational issue. About 5 minutes later a bartender brought over our drinks and we started noticing food being brought out to the booths behind us. We overheard the people behind us get asked if they wanted food to eat twice, yet our waitress walked right by us. We tried several times to flag someone down, but the opening band had already begun to play so it was difficult to get anyone's attention. \n\nAfter being ready for 15 minutes, and watching everyone else get their food orders, our waitress came back and we finally got our order in. I don't remember the specifics but we got the grilled cheese and a burger. We got our food about 5 minutes later, which was okay, nothing special. At that point we were so hungry would have been happy if they just brought us over some Taco Bell. About halfway through the meal, we both ran out of drinks, down to the last drop of watered down Coke. We began another round of find your waitress as our food got cold. And once again she walked past a few times. After about 5 minutes of trying I just gave up and walked over to the end of the bar with my empty glass. Our waitress walked over to the bar and since the bartender was busy I asked her for another Coke and PBR. She replied with a cheery, \"Sure! I'll bring that right over!\" I guess she didn't find it strange that I was trying to get my own refill. She brought over our drinks and we finished our meal.

This is awesome. CHEAP STUFF. You can call and check, or they have a sign with the dates that certain tags are discounted. I just got a whole bunch of Time Life Foods of the World books for a buck fifty each. I like that. Now, on to what I don't like.\n\nI noticed a while back that they hired a new manager for the store. I now know that all of the nice, HARD-working elderly women that staff the store are unpaid volunteers. Meanwhile, the creepy Xtian white guy gets paid to lord it over them- while actually doing little of the real work. I have observed this every time I've been there. Do these women complain? Not to me. They do the work of pricing, organizing, cleaning, ringing folks up and every other thing- and they do it with a smile.\n\nThe creepy manager dude? Well...the first thing he did to me (this was about a month ago) was ring me up with my debit card and then proceed to address me by my name which he read off my card. In a very familiar, conversational way.This felt smarmy and boundary-violating. I never introduced myself, and I didn't know his name- although I do now; it's Ken. \n\nSo, what happened on Friday? He hit me. Yes, this creepy dude actually SMACKED me on the arm as I brushed by him while entering the store. I did not body-check him, honest. He then said to me in this petulant voice: \"Are you even paying attention?\" I said: \"Paying attention to what?\" I then realized what his problem was, but didn't have much sympathy since he had just smacked me on the arm like a pathetic 12-year-old dweeb. I asked, \"Is anything broken? Do you think you'll survive?\" I think he got the point. Maybe his mother didn't teach him how to say \"excuse me\"?\n\nHey, creep: it is NOT OK to hit your customers. And, I think it's really wrong to not pay the women who do the vast majority of the work, while you get a salary to \"manage\" them.\n\nSo, I'll still stop in for discount stuff now and then, but I will continue to avoid any further direct interaction with the creep who 'manages' this store.

Where to even begin haha, well I came in to get a new hair color(I am platinum blonde And I wanted to go a Carmel brown) She said she was goin to do an all over foil with the caramel color throughout my hair, that way I will still have some of the blonde hair that was already still in my hair. When she was washing the color out, she used a toner to tone down the blonde I still had in my hair. Well the first toner didnt even work, so she used another type of toner, still didn't  even work. So, she just ended up drying my hair as is. It looked pretty nice, I liked it. She offered to add more caramel colors to it so I said yes. I think she expected me to say no because she was like \"oh well, we already did so much today, maybe you should schedule another appointment with me and we can just continue then.\" Ummm okay??? Why did you even offer then? So when I went to pay, she said it was 140 dollars. I thought to myself that couldn't be right because it didn't seem like she did that much work for it to be that much money. I asked her why it was that much and she said \"we colored your hair one whole color then added highlights and toned your hair twice\" She ended up charging my for the toners that didn't even work on my hair, which is fine I guess. But she never colored my hair one color then highlighted it. She did a foil on my head with the caramel color, the highlights that were in my hair were from the blonde hair I had when I originally walked into the salon. I looked online and for a full foil on your hair, it's 80 bucks not 140. I wouldn't mind paying so much for my hair if she ended up putting all that work in but she didn't. She completely over changed me for services she never did. I told her that and of course she got all snippy and threw a fit.

I just wanted to see some stand up comedy and that's exactly what you get.  Cost is $30.  $20 if you're a local.  Some guys are straight up stand up acts.  Some get raunchy, others have ill-conceived musical gimmicks.  Despite being a casino crowd, the group I was among the night in question really couldn't loosen up.  It seems most of them were just roaming through the place between a hand of Paigow and another max slot bet before they decided to slip into Bonkerz to \"get the Vegas experience.\"  But considering the absurd lack of stand up offerings in Vegas (I'm not talking the regular Seinfeld/Leno headliners) this will do.\n\nYou'll also have to get a drink or two during the show.  Yes, it's one of those kinds of shows so please tip your waitress.  For my money I'd rather spend $20 bucks on an hour of laughs than 2 minutes worth of wasted money on a hand of blackjack."], "labels": [["Arts & Entertainment"]], "speaker_list": null}

BUT... the quality of the gel mani itself has gone down.  Way down.  I was disappointed for so many reasons.  My design was nice though.  First, i came in with existing gel polish.  I guess the way they do things here is to not remove your old gel polish?  To me, that's odd.  They just file down as much as they can.  I've never heard that before.  It's odd to me and it's sloppy and when you put the new polish on, the new polish puts on another layer, which makes your nails look thick, and then not smooth.  Which is how mine looked - lumpy.  But because there is glitter and stones and what not, hard to see the lumps but I could see it.  And then, the peeling starts because your new gel mani is not sitting on fresh primed nails.  My gel mani didn't last even a week before the corners started peeling.  By then, I was back in LA so I couldn't go back to get it fixed.  Secondly, I told Gina before we started that one of my nails had broken and that I had crazy glued it.  I pointed it out and thought she would fix it before doing anything. Nope.  She filed that nail along with the rest of them and put the gel polish on top like the rest.  No additional glue, nothing.  The minute I got back to my friend's house, it was already cracked.  Lastly, I reiterate, I think she's a nice lady, and very talented, but, also very distracted.  She did one nail, walked away.  Did another two nails, walked away.  Did a couple of more nails, walked away.  That's how it went until my nails were done.  It's pretty frustrating.

I ordered a Wazeeri Kabob Dinner.\n\nThe food took some time to prepare; maybe ten minutes, wasn't timing it. I imagine they do not do a lot of pre-cooking. I don't mind that at all, but don't expect fast-food service times. As long as the food is good, I think the preparation time was reasonable.\n\nWhat I got was a fair size salad, which tasted fresh and clean, and I enjoyed. The rice was a sort of pilaf with raisins and cooked shredded carrots, which was fine. I'm not keen on cooked raisins in rice, but it's definitely something lots of people enjoy, so I'll withhold my judgement.\n\nThe chicken kabob was the star of the plate. Chicken kabobs are usually cooked to death, dry and unappetizing. This kabob managed to be moist without being undercooked, with slight charring on the corners (pleasantly so). Both kabobs were spiced enough to be interesting without being so spicy that you couldn't really taste the meat. The shami kabob was a nice beef kabob as well, although the chicken kabob really stood out for me.\n\nI also had three pieces of their afghani naan in a little basket. Their naan is clearly popular, I've seen lots of people leaving their attached bakery with armloads of naan bread. I like it well enough, it's hearty, tastes like whole wheat, and well-cooked, but given the choice I'd probably be happier with white puffy indian-style naan. Still, it's good.\n\nIt was a bit too much food for me, and I'm a reasonably big eater. I didn't have any trouble finishing it, but it was more than I needed for lunch. The next time around, I'll probably skip the rice, because it was my least favorite part of the meal anyway.\n\nThe service was solid, although unexceptional.\n\nI went to Afghan Village once in their older location in the same mall, and it didn't really stand out for me. This visit was something else entirely. I can see from the other reviews that some other people had less pleasing experiences than I did, and I haven't been there often enough to know which experience is more common.

The problem, and it is a persistent problem with these people, is the service is terrible. Indifferent counter help on their best days, downright surly on their bad days. It's to the point where we won't even go in there anymore. Such potential...... lost to a crabby attitude towards the customers.

The decor is clean and pleasant and we were greeted as soon as we came in.  After our orders were taken, it took quite a while for our food to arrive and we were starting to get jittery.  It was early for dinner, 4 45 , but it was not clear why it took over 35 minutes.  All i can say is that the wait was worthwhile, the food was very good.  Tandoori veggies, lamb tikka, hunters platter, chicken masala, everything was hot and tasty, spiced just right.  The sauce and yoghurt marinade were balanced and just right.  What we appreciated the most was the quality of the lamb and other meats.  They do not cut corners on quality. A satisfying dinner."], "labels": [["Restaurants"]], "speaker_list": null}

We were the only table in the whole place besides some people staying at the hotel watching the world cup and having some drinks at the bar.\n\nThe menu is very simple, not big at all. I wasn't very hungry so I just got a club house while my other got the lasagna. \n\nThe waiter wasn't paying any attention to us at all, he was busy watching the game with the guys at the bar, we had to keep getting his attention. If we were the only table don't you think he should of gave us just a little more attention?\n\nWhen the food finally came, I saw all these yellowish looking stuff on my sandwich, the description said mayonnaise NOT HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE! I dislike mustard and I was shocked to see honey mustard all over my sandwich, I have never seen a club house with mustard on it, so I was very surprised.\n\nThe lasagna looked very portion packed and when we asked about it, the waiter said \"its frozen, we just heat is up\" you would assume for 20 bucks at least could  make their own lasagna. What's the point going to a restaurant to have something heated up when you can do the same thing at home?\n\nI'm glad I had to chance to see what this place was about as I was curious but I will never be going back."], "labels": [["Restaurants"]], "speaker_list": null}

Not that it's particularly bad or anything but it just doesn't live up to the standards set by its competition. Food was average and they didn't have the torched sushis, service was surprisingly slow since they had about three servers working and not a lot of people to serve.\n\nIf you're ever in the area looking to have some sushi, do yourself a favor and walk down the street to another restaurant."], "labels": [["Restaurants"]], "speaker_list": null}

They also have places for little kids to play, books and toys, etc. \n\nLocated in the Huntingon Reservation off of Wolf Road in Westlake. There's a little picnic area nearby with a huge field.\n\nI freaking love the Metroparks!!
